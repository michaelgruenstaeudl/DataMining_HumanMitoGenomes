            "Summary",
            "The recently enriched genomic history of Indigenous groups in the Americas is still meager concerning continental Central America. Here, we report ten pre-Hispanic (plus two early colonial) genomes and 84 genome-wide profiles from seven groups presently living in Panama. Our analyses reveal that pre-Hispanic demographic events contributed to the extensive genetic structure currently seen in the area, which is also characterized by a distinctive Isthmo-Colombian Indigenous component. This component drives these populations on a specific variability axis and derives from the local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin(s). Two of these ancestries were differentially associated to Pleistocene Indigenous groups that also moved into South America, leaving heterogenous genetic footprints. An additional Pleistocene ancestry was brought by a still unsampled population of the Isthmus (UPopI) that remained restricted to the Isthmian area, expanded locally during the early Holocene, and left genomic traces up to the present day.",

            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the peopling of sub-Arctic America started from Beringia before, during, and immediately after late Glacial times. Initial settlement attempts were followed by a more widespread peopling that reached southern South America as early as \u223c15 thousand years ago (kya). Recent studies of ancient and modern genomes describe a complex scenario prior to European contact with multiple migrations from Beringia, as initially suggested by mitochondrial DNA\u00a0(mtDNA) data as well as demographic spreads and admixture events along the two continents. The great majority of ancestries in early Native Americans (NAs, here used to indicate Indigenous groups) derive from an ancestral Beringian population(s) that differentiated sometime between \u223c22 and \u223c18 kya and likely exhibited genetic sub-structure that may explain the initial late Glacial migration(s) as well as the spread of the so-called UPopA (unknown population in the Americas) whose legacy reappears in Central America \u223c8.7 kya, leaving signs in the gene pool of the Mixe. In unglaciated eastern Beringia/northern North America, the first peoples split into two branches called Northern NA (NNA, or ANC-B) and Southern NA (SNA, or ANC-A). The most ancient representatives of SNA are individuals who were living on both sides of the Rocky Mountains more than 10 kya: the Clovis-associated Anzick-1 and the Spirit Cave individuals associated with Western Stemmed technology. Ancient individuals carrying SNA ancestries crossed the Panama land bridge and entered South America. Their fast spread along the southern continent is evidenced by the earliest archaeological human presence in the Southern Cone at 14.6 kya and by ancient human genomes dating more than 9 kya on both sides of the continent: at Cuncaicha (Peru) and Los Rieles (Chile) on the Pacific and Lapa do Santo and Lagoa Santa (Brazil) on the Atlantic. Another UPop (UPopY) with Australasian ancestry may have contributed to the early peopling of South America as recognized in one sample from the Lagoa Santa site and in some Amazonian groups that experienced isolation events (e.g., Surui and Karitiana).",
            "However, the demographic dynamics underlying many of these events, before and after European contact, are still uncharacterized, especially at the regional level. The Panamanian isthmus lies between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and connects the two American continents. It was the only land bridge during the initial peopling of South America and has remained a crossroads of goods, technologies, ideas, and peoples throughout history, including more recent colonial times. In light of Panama\u2019s geographic location, the archaeogenomic study of its past can reveal its demographic history, including movements between North and South America.",
            "Ethics and community engagement",
            "This study involves international collaborative efforts that bring together archaeologists, geneticists, historians, anthropologists, and computer engineers to incorporate existing knowledge with genomic information about pre-Hispanic as well as modern Indigenous individuals from the Isthmus of Panama. It was possible with the support of local authorities and Indigenous peoples of Panama and centrally involved local co-authors of the present paper (J.R., T.M., M.T., J.M.P., R.C., J.M., and J.G.M.) with years of experience in the Isthmo-Colombian region. Samples from the ancient individuals were collected for the ArtEmpire European Research Council (ERC) project (Consolidator Grant CoG-2014 no. 648535) in collaboration with the Patronato Panam\u00e1 Viejo (PaPV) as established by the Convenio Espec\u00edfico de colaboraci\u00f3n entre el Patronato Panam\u00e1 Viejo de la Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 y la Universidad Pablo de Olavide, de Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, signed on January 20th, 2016. Excavations were undertaken with the permission of the Republic of Panama\u2019s Instituto Nacional de Cultura, Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Patrimonio Hist\u00f3rico (DNPH), Resoluci\u00f3n DNPH no. 139-16 of November 11th, 2016, and resoluci\u00f3n DNPH no. 006-18 of January 8th, 2018. Selected samples from bone and teeth were exported to Pavia (Italy) and Mannheim (Germany) in accordance with the Permission of the Republic of Panama\u2019s Instituto Nacional de Cultura, Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Patrimonio Hist\u00f3rico, Resoluci\u00f3n no. 080-17 DNPH of April 19th, 2017, and resoluci\u00f3n no. 304-18 DNPH of September 26th, 2018. Even though no ties to the pre-Hispanic inhabitants have been stated, we are engaging local Indigenous communities to present the information from this study and to seek their views. In general, the project has been designed to maximize opportunities for public engagement, as testified by ongoing meetings with local interest groups to discuss research design and findingst. In order to increase positive social impact, some information on the ancient samples are publicly available in the ArtEmpire\u2019s database, translated into Spanish to increase accessibility (https://artempire.cica.es/), and a documentary also has been released (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BmxppS4oks).",
            "The collection of the modern Indigenous samples was approved by the Comit\u00e9 de Bio\u00e9tica de la investigaci\u00f3n del Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas and undertaken by the Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud (ICGES, Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies) of Panama. The ICGES explained the project to community leaders in their native languages and sent biological samples to the Department of Biology and Biotechnology of the University of Pavia for DNA extraction and analysis in agreement with the memorandum of understanding (written in English and Spanish) signed on August 9th, 2016. All experimental procedures and individual written informed consent forms were also reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Experimentation of the University of Pavia, Board minutes of October 5th, 2010, and April 11th, 2013. We are particularly grateful to and acknowledge the ancient and modern people who shared their DNAs.",
            "Panama: archaeology and history",
            "Paleoecological and archaeological data point to a continuous human inhabitation of the Isthmo-Colombian area from approximately 16 kya. Clear evidence for the cultivation of domesticated plants, including maize (Zea mays), manioc (Manihot esculenta), and squash (Cucurbita moschata), dates back to more than 8\u20134.5 kya, while Panama\u2019s first pottery (Monagrillo ware) appeared about 4.5 kya. By 3 kya, the area\u2019s western region possesses all the characteristics of a coherent historical unit (Greater Chiriqu\u00ed, which extended into present-day Costa Rica), while this consensus is not available for the central and eastern regions, often termed Greater Cocl\u00e9 and Greater Dari\u00e9n (see specific section in STAR Methods for further details).",
            "From approximately 500 BCE to 1,500 CE, relations among neighbors oscillated between cooperation driven by exchange and trade and conflict over land and resources. Although polities often called chiefdoms expanded and contracted, there is no evidence for aggressive empire building as in Mexico or the Andes. On the eve of the Spanish invasion, historians and most archaeologists agree that much of the central and eastern Isthmus was inhabited by Indigenous polities that spoke languages in the Nuclear Chibchan family (with variants of languages in the Chocoan family probably also spoken on the Pacific side) and used the \u201clanguage of Cueva\u201d as a lingua franca (either a trade language or a group of vernaculars) in a linguistically complex region, much as the Hu\u00ebtar did in Costa Rica. Based on partial and fragmentary data, historians have ventured estimates of the pre-Hispanic population in those areas where the language of Cueva was spoken at European contact from 130,000 to 240,000 people and archaeologists have identified specific villages capable of sustaining up to 2,400 inhabitants. After nearly one millennium of less destructive war and trade among neighbors, European incursions provoked a rapid decline in the region\u2019s Indigenous populations. However, not all Indigenous groups experienced simultaneous demographic decline. Historical records suggest that an expansion among the Guna followed the reduction of other Indigenous groups.",
            "Panama: Genetics",
            "To date uniparental systems have been examined to assess the genetic history of Panama: mtDNA data identified specific lineages predating the Clovis technological horizon (13.2 kya), while the comparison with Y chromosome data revealed a sex bias during the colonial period consistent with \u201cmore native men perishing or being deprived of reproductive rights than women\u201d. Similar to mtDNA data, patterns of regional genetic continuity in some Indigenous American (IA) communities have been inferred from the analysis of nuclear genomes from continental Central America, but without ancient DNA (aDNA) data from the Isthmian land bridge.",
            "To refine the human genetic history of the Isthmus, for the first time we have directly tested and analyzed autosomal markers of both pre-Hispanic human remains and contemporary Indigenous groups from Panama. Twenty ancient individuals (13 of them pre-Hispanic and seven colonial) were sampled from seven different archaeological excavations along the Pacific coast of Panama City, located from the residential area of Coco del Mar to the remnants of Old Panama\u2019s Cathedral in Panam\u00e1 Viejo, an area of pre-Hispanic inhabitation and the site of the colonial city from 1,519 to 1,671 CE. Modern sampling for a total of 84 individuals, 76 self-identified as associated with five different Indigenous groups plus four self-designated \u201cMoreno\u201d and four self-identified \u201cMestizo\u201d individuals (Figure\u00a01A; Table S1), took place in Panama City as well as in the provinces and Indigenous territories.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Results",
            "Although the tropical environment and the proximity of the excavation sites to the ocean, with recurrent flooding, challenge the possibility of DNA preservation, we were able to obtain some of the first reliable aDNA data from the Isthmus. Starting from the initial collection of samples from 20 ancient individuals, we eventually assembled ancient low-coverage (\u22650.01X) genomes from 12 unrelated individuals (one female and eleven males), including ten from pre-Hispanic times (radiocarbon dated from 603 to 1,430 CE). Molecular decay analyses demonstrated the poor preservation of endogenous DNA, but error rate and validation tests confirmed the reliability of the retrieved genomic data (Table S2). In order to characterize the genetics of Isthmian individuals with the greatest possible spatial range and temporal depth, the 12 ancient genomes were compared with genome-wide data from 74 unrelated modern Panamanians and to available modern and ancient data by assembling different datasets (STAR Methods; Table S3).",
            "Uniparental lineages of pre-Hispanic Panamanians",
            "The evaluation of uniparental markers revealed the presence of the \u201cpan-American\u201d mtDNA haplogroups A2 and B2 in the pre-Hispanic samples, while two haplogroups, H1j1a and L2a1c2a, typical of Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans, respectively, were identified in the samples taken from colonial ancient individuals (Figure\u00a0S1A; Table S1).",
            "The most represented mtDNA haplogroup of pre-Hispanic Panamanians, A2af1, was previously identified (as A2af) at high frequencies among present-day Panamanians, mainly in the Comarca of Guna Yala. It is characterized by the so-called \u201cHu\u00ebtar deletion,\u201d a peculiar 6-bp control-region deletion initially detected in the Chibchan-speaking Hu\u00ebtar from Costa Rica.",
            "The eight pre-contact Y chromosomes are positive for the L54 marker, which characterizes all the Indigenous American branches of haplogroup Q (Figure\u00a0S1B). Two individuals (PAPV118, PAPV175) were further sub-classified as Q1b1a1a-M3 and one (PAPV117) as Q1b1a1a1-M848, the most frequent haplogroups among Indigenous peoples of the Americas.",
            "Archaeological and anthropological significance of two burials in Panam\u00e1 Viejo and Coco del Mar",
            "An initial evaluation of the ancient low-coverage genomes made it possible to address long-standing anthropological and archaeological questions regarding the possible genetic relationships among individuals buried together. These cases included the ten human remains (one adult, nearly complete, female skeleton with nine adult male skulls beneath and around her) recovered from a pre-Hispanic burial denominated Tumba 1 underneath the Plaza Mayor of Panam\u00e1 Viejo, and a similar burial at Coco del Mar (approximately 1\u00a0km to the west of Panam\u00e1 Viejo), where a female skeleton was found accompanied by three male crania (Figure\u00a01B). Crania interred with prestigious individuals have been interpreted as evidence either of ancestor veneration or\u00a0of\u00a0human sacrifice with the ostentation of trophy heads. Arguments in either case draw on presumed (recent or ancestral) tribal and biological relationships. Using genome-wide data, we can now exclude any genetic relatedness among the individuals. Moreover, the two females exhibit different mtDNA haplogroups (D1 and B2, respectively) with respect to the surrounding male crania (A2af1a1, B2b, and B2d in Tumba 1; A2af1b, A2w, and B2d in Coco del Mar).",
            "In combination with these genetic results, radiocarbon dates obtained for the pre-Hispanic individuals sampled from Panam\u00e1 Viejo and Coco del Mar point toward a more complex and nuanced interpretation. The two female figures, PAPV109 (1265-1375 CE) and PAPV172 (1051-1221 CE), were interred with crania dated from 603 to 1,390 CE (2 sigma) in the first case and from 657 to 1,430 CE (2 sigma) in the second (Figure\u00a01B). Hence, skulls spanning over 700 years, including the area\u2019s earliest and latest pre-Hispanic remains recovered to date, accompanied each of the main individuals. Seven of the skulls that accompanied PAPV109 belonged to individuals who pre-dated her by hundreds of years, and the other two were roughly contemporary. One of the crania buried with PAPV172 belonged to a male individual who lived roughly 500 years before her, and the other two to male individuals deceased and buried over the subsequent 300 years. Drawing upon on Cueva as well as Guna ethnography (: pp. 26, 87, 281, 282, 476\u2013478: Vol. 2, pp. 125\u2013154), crania kept for hundreds of years or even deposited after the main interment probably pertained to enemy chiefs whose death in battle guaranteed their spirits\u2019 eternal repose. Their skulls may have provided sorcerers and healers, in this case female seers or tequina, a gateway to knowledge about enemies as well as the afterlife. These women entered the next world with the tools of their trade (the skulls), like other individuals interred in Panam\u00e1 Viejo (a \u201cmusician\u201d poised as if playing her instrument, and a seated adolescent with flint blades and stingray tail barbs) or mentioned in Spanish chronicles (farmers buried with corn) (: pp. 125\u2013154). The heads of prestigious enemies obtained in warfare would have facilitated the seers\u2019 access to their strength and knowledge as well as their ability to communicate with other worlds. The different mtDNA lineages of these individuals might also support their origins from various pre-Hispanic groups, since we have found significant differences in the haplogroup distribution among the modern Indigenous populations analyzed here (p value\u00a0< 0.0001). Although the literature contains reference to wives, slaves, and loyal servants sacrificed with their chiefs, these burials illustrate a different practice. Their arrangement stands out among a great diversity of pre-Hispanic interments over a wide zone of the Panamanian Pacific, some of these including offerings in local pottery, metal, lapidary, shell, and bone work, and many burial modes, including bones deposited in urns or bundles. PAPV172\u2019s head was found beneath a ceramic offering, while five ceramic pots with offerings accompanied PAPV109, who also wore a necklace fashioned from thorny oyster shells (Spondylus spp.). Within the variety of pre-Hispanic burial patterns observed to date, individuals PAPV109 and PAPV172 appear unique on a local as well as a regional level.",
            "Deciphering genomic variation on the Isthmus",
            "The analyses conducted in this study facilitate a microgeographic and diachronic assessment of Indigenous autosomal variation in this strategic region. The characterization of the pre-colonial genetic histories is clouded by the impacts of colonization. This is evident in the distinctive genetic profiles that differentiate the current gene pool of the Panamanian groups as obtained by the ADMIXTURE analyses (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). The two groups that experienced a history of admixture, the self-identified \u201cMoreno\u201d and \u201cMestizo,\u201d reveal large proportions of their genomes not derived from Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Both show a comparable proportion of ancestry predominant in Europeans (K2) and the component common to Africans (K3) is more prevalent in the \u201cMoreno\u201d group; the \u201cMestizo\u201d are characterized by a component also identified in Asians (K4). The coexistence of different continental genomic ancestries is common in the Americas, due to complex admixture that started during the colonial period. In Panama, where European colonization began in 1,502 CE, this is particularly evident in the \u201cMestizo,\u201d but it is also revealed by individuals who self-identified as Indigenous and genealogically unadmixed, showing variable amounts of African and European ancestries in their genomes, with the lowest average values in the Guna, followed by the Ng\u00e4be.",
            "The modern and ancient Isthmian individuals are also characterized by a specific Indigenous component, which has been identified considering only modern individuals (K6, Figure\u00a0S2A) as well as with the addition of ancient individuals (K9, Figure\u00a02A). This component drives the Isthmo-Colombian axis, depicted by the first (main) component in the principal-component analysis (PCA) of Indigenous groups (Figure\u00a02B), which includes ancient and modern Panamanians together with the Cab\u00e9car from southern Costa Rica and two populations from northern Colombia (the Wayuu and the admixed Columbia [CLM]). The Indigenous groups from the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area form two closely related western clusters (one with the Ng\u00e4be and the other including Bribri, Naso, and Cab\u00e9car). The pre-Hispanic individuals group together in the middle of the Isthmo-Colombian genetic landscape and create a distinct branch in the outgroup f3 statistics hierarchical tree, together with a few self-identified \u201cMoreno\u201d (Figure\u00a0S3A), suggesting the integration of pre-Hispanic individuals into the forming multi-cultural colonial groups. The genetic closeness of the pre-Hispanic individuals is possibly expected when considering the geographic proximity of the archaeological excavations but less expected when taking into account the radiocarbon dates, from 603 to 1,430 CE, thus revealing a genetic continuity for almost one thousand years (Table S1). The modern Indigenous populations from the Greater Dari\u00e9n area of cultural influence to the east of the region (Guna, Ember\u00e1, and northern Colombians) create distinct groups in the PCA plot, well separated from the Greater Chiriqu\u00ed populations in the west.",
            "The details of this genetic sub-structure (and heterogeneity) on the Isthmus became apparent by analyzing the nearly unadmixed Indigenous haplotypes (uIA217 dataset) with fineSTRUCTURE (Figures 3A and S4A). Among the five Isthmian genetic clusters, four are specific to Indigenous Panamanian groups (PaNASO, PaNGABE, PaEMBERA, PaGUNA), while the Bribri individuals form a separate cluster (here called Western Isthmus) with the Cab\u00e9car from Costa Rica. The latter branch, together with Naso and Ng\u00e4be, forms a macro-group that might be associated with the geographic region of the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area. Genetically distinct are the Ember\u00e1 and the Guna, suggesting a wider genetic variation in the Greater Dari\u00e9n cultural region. The Guna also show the highest level of similarity in intra- and inter-cluster comparisons (Figures 3B and S4B), analogous only to two Indigenous groups that experienced isolation events, the Amazonian Surui and Karitiana, and preserved an ancient Australasian-related ancestry, the so-called UPopY. We formally looked for UPopY variants in the Isthmus with f4 statistics in the form f4 (W/Panama, X/Mixe; Y/Australasia, Mbuti) without finding any significant sign of admixture or gene flow (Figure\u00a0S5A). The same statistics were used to formally test the average correlation in allele frequency differences (mixture of ancestries) within the Isthmo-Colombian area (Figure\u00a02C). This analysis provides statistical support to the genetic interactions (Z score often\u00a0< |3|) in the western Isthmian area, eventually extended to Cab\u00e9car, Naso, and Ng\u00e4be. On the other hand, it reveals close relationships among the Ember\u00e1 and northern Colombians (CLM and Wayuu). Finally, the pre-Hispanic communities inhabiting the Pacific coast in the area of Panama City cluster together with the Guna compared with other Isthmo-Colombian populations (Z score\u00a0< |3|), except for the Ng\u00e4be.",
            "Deciphering genomic connections outside the Isthmus",
            "Previous studies have already provided hints of genetic patterns in the Isthmo-Colombian region, eventually extended to other groups that speak Chibchan languages. Here, we first confirmed that the previously discussed Isthmian component is also detectable in additional Chibchan-speaking populations genotyped with a different array (Arhuaco and Kogi from Colombia; Guaym\u00ed, Cab\u00e9car, Teribe, Bribri, Hu\u00ebtar, and Maleku from Costa Rica) and that its highest legacy can be detected in the western Isthmian land bridge consisting of the present-day countries of Panama and Costa Rica (Figure\u00a0S2C). We have now detailed patterns of genomic variation of the area\u2019s core population(s), represented by pre-Hispanic Isthmian individuals and modern Panamanians, underlining their unique features in the Americas\u2019 genetic landscape.",
            "The f-statistics tests not only detected higher levels of shared genetic history between ancient and present-day groups of the Isthmian area extended to Costa Rica (Cab\u00e9car) and northern Colombia (CLM and Wayuu) in comparison with other ancient and modern populations (Figures 4 and S3B) but also revealed different levels of shared ancestries in the Isthmian groups (Figure\u00a0S5B). The\u00a0same pattern has been detected in the neighbor-joining tree\u00a0(based on outgroup f3 statistics and rooted with an ancient Beringian genome; Figure\u00a0S3C) of ancient and modern IA groups. This graph identifies an early Isthmo-Colombian branch with different sub-branches. This and the additional IA branches (with a geographic pattern) largely overlap with the haplotype-based clusters identified in the American-wide uIA217 dataset (Figure\u00a03A), where in the absence of data from ancient individuals, the distinctiveness of the Isthmo-Colombian area in the modern America genomic structure remains evident.",
            "A pre-Hispanic origin of the Isthmo-Colombian distinctiveness is suggested by our analysis of effective population size based on the identical-by-descent (IBD) segments. A reduction in the population size of the Panamanian groups probably began during pre-colonial times (\u223c1 kya; inset of Figure\u00a03C), thus before the average time of the other IA population groups taken together. This trend is mainly driven by the Guna, who on the other hand show unreliable population size (Ne) values when considering short fragments (<8 cM, Figure\u00a0S4C). Therefore, we repeated this analysis without the Guna, confirming an earlier beginning of the Ne reduction in the Panamanian IA groups that became steeper in colonial times (Figure\u00a0S4D). Finally, Ne estimates based on IBD longer (and more reliable) fragments (>8 cM) allowed us to confirm this trend for the Guna (Figure\u00a0S4E). Three factors may have contributed to this demographic pattern: (1) a decrease in the population size that started before European contact; (2) a less intensive impact of European colonialism, as also suggested by the lower peaks of IBD bins for most Panamanian groups; and (3) an earlier and steeper demographic recovery after contact than in other IA populations, especially evident in Guna and Ng\u00e4be who show an enrichment of shorter IBD segments, around 7\u201313 Mb, and then a fast decrease of IBD blocks (Figure\u00a03C). All explanations are plausible and not mutually exclusive. Before European contact,\u00a0cultural changes in the Panama Bay\u00a0region may have accompanied migrations and demographic shifts (see \u201cPanama: archaeology and history\u201d and, in the STAR Methods section, \u201cInsights into pre-Hispanic Panama\u201d). This possibility finds support from other genetic analyses that showed a high level of genomic drift shared by the Isthmian Indigenous groups, including the ancient individuals sampled, on both allele frequencies and haplotypes (see PCA plots and all the trees), as well as from the comparison of the IBD fragments shared among the Panamanian groups and with other IA populations (Figure\u00a0S4F). The latter analysis reveals ancient interactions (from at least 2,500 years ago) within the\u00a0Isthmo-Colombian area, much stronger and temporally extended among the western populations (Cab\u00e9car, Bribri, and Naso) currently living in the geographic region associated with the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area. On the eastern part of the Isthmus, the Guna also show a number of short (older) blocks shared with the Maya from Mexico, while the Ember\u00e1 share shorter blocks with South American populations. Thus, the former probably received ancient genetic inputs from the north, while the latter admixed with external southern sources. The Guna also show a direct connection with the ancestors of North and Central American populations in the TreeMix maximum likelihood (ML) tree when two migration edges (gene flows) are added (Figure\u00a05A). Such an ancient legacy is also confirmed by the Panamanian mtDNA tree. The most-represented haplogroups among ancient and modern Panamanian mitogenomes belong to the four main pan-American founding lineages (A2, B2, C1, and D1; Figure\u00a05B). We also identified four Isthmo-specific sub-branches, the most represented one (A2af1) is dated at 15.82 \u00b1 4.09 kya (Figure\u00a0S1A). Finally, the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) of Panamanian mtDNAs shows an increase in population size starting in the early Holocene (\u223c10 kya) (inset of Figure\u00a05B).",
            "A previously undescribed ancestry among ancient Indigenous peoples of the Americas?",
            "To further understand the peculiarities of the Isthmo-Colombian populations within the context of the most updated archaeogenomic scenario of non-Arctic America (see Introduction), we used f4 statistics, which controls for possible biases deriving from population-specific drift, to compare ancient individuals and contemporary Indigenous groups to the individuals we sampled. As expected, the Isthmus shows an excess of allele sharing with modern and ancient Indigenous populations from Central and South America when compared with Ancestral Beringia (USR-1, Upward Sun River, Alaska, \u223c11.5 kya) and NNA (represented by ASO, Ancient Southwestern Ontario, \u223c4.2 kya) genomes, but this picture is more intricate when dealing with the SNA-related ancient genomes (Table S4). The affinities between the (Y/tested) Isthmian populations and other Indigenous (X) groups are significantly stronger in relation to Anzick-1 (Montana, \u223c12.8 kya) than to Spirit Cave (Nevada, \u223c10.9 kya) (W individuals; Figure\u00a06A), suggesting that Isthmian populations are related to Spirit Cave as much as to other Indigenous groups, while Anzick-1 is an outgroup to them. We directly tested the relationships of Isthmian and other Central/South American populations with Anzick-1 and Spirit Cave, highlighting a differential trend that becomes significant with a higher molecular resolution power, i.e., more single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Figures 2C and S5C). Moreover, the Isthmus seems more closely related to Spirit Cave than to Anzick-1 in comparison with Ancestral Beringia.",
            "Such genomic differences are confirmed when moving southward in Central America (Table S4) and particularly for the early ancient genomes excavated on the southern continent. The Pacific coast populations (Los Rieles, Chile, \u223c10.9 kya) exhibit greater affinity to Spirit Cave, while the ancient genomes from the Atlantic side show the same pattern as Anzick-1 when considering individuals older than \u223c7 kya (Lagoa Santa, Brazil, \u223c10.4 kya). These distinctive signals persisted up to about 7 kya, when they were probably erased by a major population turnover in South America, facilitated by a widespread population decline due to mid-Holocene climate changes.",
            "The results of previous analyses revealed that Isthmian and non-Isthmian IA populations are differentially related to available Pleistocene individuals, suggesting the contribution of different sources. To test whether the Isthmian and non-Isthmian groups derived from the same or distinct ancestral populations, we used qpWave, which estimates the minimum number of sources necessary to explain the observed genetic composition of population groups. Significance values are consistent with pairs of Isthmian and non-Isthmian groups deriving from at least two separate streams of ancestry, as attested by rank 1\u00a0p value\u00a0< 0.01 in most comparisons, especially for the Guna (Figure\u00a06B). This finding demonstrates that the distinctiveness of the Isthmo-Colombian area cannot be explained by genetic drift alone, as recently inferred in other population contexts. The Guna also show lower values (mostly <25th percentile) of shared genetic history with ancient genomes representative of well-known Indigenous ancestries than the average of the one shared by other IA populations (Figure\u00a0S3D). Therefore, we modeled admixture graphs looking for the most plausible origin of the ancestral source(s) of the Isthmian component (Figures S6 and S7; see also the specific section of STAR Methods for further details). The best supported topology successfully tested the hypothesis that the ancestral gene pool of the Isthmo-Colombian area, here represented by pre-Hispanic Panamanians, derives from a local admixture between different ancestral components (Figure\u00a07). One derives from the differential mixture of two ancestries, SNA1 and SNA2, that in turn stem from an ancestral SNA source. This scenario is strongly suggestive of the first split between SNA and NNA occurring in Beringia, thus further north than generally proposed. The NNA ancient individual in Figure\u00a07, ASO (\u223c4.2 kya), results from an admixture between NNA and SNA1. We could not identify an unadmixed proxy for the NNA ancestry among the available modern and ancient individuals (Figure\u00a0S6H), but NNA does not seem to be involved in shaping the Isthmian genomic pool. Founding populations carrying the SNA1 ancestry probably took part in an early peopling of the double continent passing through the Isthmus and leaving signals on both sides of South America, as attested by two of the most ancient genomes, Lagoa Santa in Brazil (\u223c10.4 kya) and Los Rieles in Chile (\u223c10.9 kya). The former also confirms a few traces of UPopY, the UPop of Australasian ancestry, which was previously proposed to have contributed to the early peopling of South America. On the other hand, only Los Rieles shows significant inputs of the SNA2 ancestry, which moved later or slower than SNA1 through the Americas, admixing multiple times with the first settlers along the way, as demonstrated by the ancient admixed genomes of Spirit Cave in North America and Mayahak Cab Pek (Belize, \u223c9.3 kya) and the ancient Isthmians (this study) in Central America. Once SNA2 reached South America, it probably left a stronger contribution on the Pacific side, as suggested by Los Rieles and supported by the differential pattern depicted by the f4 statistics (Table S4). However, to fully explain the genetic variation of pre-Hispanic Panama, we need to consider an additional ancestry: an ancestral unsampled population of the Isthmus (UPopI; Figure\u00a07), which is still unrepresented in the ancient dataset, but left its strongest traces in the contemporary Guna. UPopI parallels the Spirit Cave branch of SNA2, testifying to a long-shared drift between the pre-Hispanic Guna and the ancient Isthmian (including pre-Hispanic) individuals sampled. This best-fitting model was also checked without considering UPopI and replacing Spirit Cave with Anzick-1 and Guna with Mixe, previously used to identify UPopA, without finding any statistically supported graph (Figures S7D\u2013S7F). Therefore, it is supported that Anzick-1 and Spirit Cave might represent different ancestries and UPopI is a still unsampled population distinct from UPopA. UPopI likely originated in the north during the late Pleistocene, as attested by the age (\u223c15 kya, Figure\u00a0S1A) of the entire mtDNA haplogroup A2af1 that probably represents its mitochondrial legacy, and expanded more than 10 kya in the Isthmo-Colombian area (according to mitogenome data; inset of Figure\u00a05B). These ancestries left different traces in pre-Hispanic Isthmian individuals and contemporary Panamanian groups (Figure\u00a07), and only the presence of UPopI provides significant support for our final model. It also explains the ancestral component, already seen in the ADMIXTURE analyses, which is geographically restricted to the Isthmo-Colombian area and prevalent in the Guna, where it was probably maintained by a high level of isolation. Finally, this specific ancestry could explain the \u201carchaeogenomic distinctiveness\u201d of the Isthmo-Colombian area within the genomic landscape of IA groups.",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "Our work enriches the IA genomic database with autosomal data from cultural groups of Panama and ten low-coverage pre-Hispanic genomes obtained from human remains excavated in the tropical area of Panama City on the Pacific Ocean. The ancient genetic profiles from Panam\u00e1 Viejo and Coco del Mar sites, radiocarbon dated from 603 to 1,430 CE, confirm similarities in the gene pool of this pre-Hispanic population(s), suggesting common origins. The diachronic comparison with population groups presently living in Panama allowed us to identify genetic similarities with the Guna and Ng\u00e4be and suggestive connections with some admixed individuals, implying that, in the wake of the conquest, there was extensive gene flow. A genetic sub-structure has been identified in the entire Isthmo-Colombian region, with a macro-group encompassing the Cab\u00e9car, Bribri, Naso, and Ng\u00e4be, who currently live in the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area. A wider genetic variation characterizes eastern Panama, here represented by pre-Hispanic individuals from Panam\u00e1\u00a0Viejo and Coco del Mar plus Guna, Ember\u00e1, and northern Colombians. Our analyses suggest that pre-Hispanic demographic changes and isolation events, evident in the Guna, contributed to create the genetic structure currently seen in the region. Moreover, through allele frequency analyses and haplotype-based reconstructions, we describe the presence of a specific axis of Indigenous genetic variation in the Americas, which is typical in\u00a0the Isthmo-Colombian area and possibly extended to other Chibchan-speaking groups. This component was present not only among pre-Hispanic Isthmian individuals but also strongly characterizes current Panamanian groups, particularly the Guna, surviving both pre-colonial demographic fluctuations and the genetic bottleneck (and admixture) caused by colonialism.",
            "The detection of this component has an impact that expands far beyond the Isthmo-Colombian area and the ancestry of its past and current inhabitants. The following clues point to the scenario that it arose in the late Pleistocene: (1) the pre-Clovis age of the Isthmian-specific mtDNA haplogroup A2af1, (2) the internal structure that emerges when only the Indigenous genome-wide variation is analyzed, (3) the longer shared genetic history among Isthmo-Colombian populations with respect to other Indigenous populations, and (4) the differential relationships with Pleistocene individuals from North America. Next, to identify its ancestral source(s), we built a statistically significant model that explains this Isthmo-Colombian component as a local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin. At least two SNA ancestries, SNA1 and SNA2, differentially associated to available Pleistocene genomes, should be considered, as well as an additional Isthmian-specific ancestry. The latter requires the contribution of UPopI, which stemmed from the same source (SNA2) that contributed to the pre-Clovis groups with Western Stemmed technologies associated with Spirit Cave and, according to mitogenome data, expanded within the Isthmo-Colombian area during the early Holocene.",
            "The ancestral admixtures described here were probably bound to now-submerged archeological sites on the Pacific coast of the Isthmus. Nevertheless, the genomes of the pre-Hispanic individuals from Panam\u00e1\u00a0Viejo and Coco del Mar attest to these events, and the site of Vampiros-1 (initially named Cueva de los Vampiros), the only Pleistocene site on the lower Isthmian land bridge that contains cultural, but not human, skeletal remains, provides further archeological support. Vampiros-1 shows evidence of both Clovis and Fluted Fishtail Point lithic traditions indicating that hunter-gatherers of extra-Isthmian origin were on the lower Isthmus 13.2\u201311.7 kya with specific composite weaponry and cutting/scraping tools. Our model also fits well with recent archeological records from both sides of the Isthmo-Colombian area. Archeological findings in southern North America report early peopling as far south as central northern Mexico around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and more widespread settlements in warmer pre-Clovis times (14.7\u201312.9 kya). The cultural heterogeneity observed among the oldest reliable pre-Clovis archaeological sites of South America (dated 15.1\u201314.0 kya) along the Pacific coastal zone (Huaca Pietra in Central Andes; Monte Verde II in South Andes) and in the Pampas (Arroyo Seco 2) can be explained considering a deeper chronological time (between 16.6 and 15.1 kya) for the Isthmian crossing that led to the initial peopling of South America.",
            "The preservation effect of an ancient legacy in \u201coutlier populations,\u201d such as the Guna, recalls that of Sardinians and Basques in Europe. In the European context, Sardinians maintained the most evident traces of the early European Neolithic farmers. Among Indigenous peoples, some Amazonian groups, which match the very high internal similarities of the Guna, have preserved the specific ancestry of a UPop linked to Australasia. In the Isthmian context, demographic events connected to both pre-Hispanic and colonial times contributed to differentially retain and further shape the IA ancestries.",
            "Limitations of study",
            "The models reported in this study are based on 12 ancient low-coverage genomes from two archeological sites and genome-wide data from 74 unrelated modern Panamanians. These data provide a suggestive baseline for future interdisciplinary studies on the Isthmo-Colombian crossroads. High-coverage genomic data, from a wider time frame (since early Holocene to colonial times) and other archeological sites (across the entire Isthmo-Colombian area), as well as whole genomes from present-day individuals, are needed to continue to refine the region\u2019s genetic history. This additional work, with more statistical power and higher molecular resolution, will be essential to further detail the genetic patterns (and\u00a0ancestries) that we have identified in the Panamanian population(s) and to reconstruct variation in population sizes over time.",

            "From ca. 4.5 kya agriculture along Panama\u2019s Pacific watershed was complemented by fishing in rivers and estuaries, and catching birds, large snakes and iguanas (Iguanidae spp.), and hunting mammals with body masses\u00a0< 55\u00a0kg on the offshore Pearl Island archipelago. Some of these, e.g., white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and rodents including agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and paca (Cuniculus paca), forage in human trash and eat crops in gardens and fields. On Pedro Gonzalez (Pearl Islands), a very small deer (Mazama sp.) (7-10\u00a0kg) was extirpated by hunting. Dolphins (Tursiops and Delphinus) were consumed 6.2-5.6 kya and were possibly killed when beached. Later, with the establishment of villages ca 4-2 kya, community activities diversified, especially regarding the exchange of goods. Hunting strategies now included communal drives in Pacific wooded savannas. Deer meat was stored salted and dried and then served at special feasts.",
            "Inhabitation of the Caribbean side of the Central American Isthmus (Costa Rica) began in the Late Pleistocene (13.4-12 kya). In the very humid central Caribbean Panama, human activities date back to 5.9 kya when groups crossed the Central Cordillera to collect food and materials not available on the opposite side, e.g., embalming agents.",
            "On the central Caribbean, maize is found in rock shelters with earth ovens from about 3.5 kya. Materials analysis demonstrates that Monagrillo pottery found here was manufactured in the central Pacific watershed. One site in the coastal lowlands of Cocl\u00e9 province (Zapotal, PR-32), which used Monagrillo pottery, consisted of dwellings stratified within a shell-bearing midden accumulated between 4.3 and 3.2 kya. Zapotal has the characteristics of a small village. There are very large numbers of edge-ground cobbles here, which were used at many 8-3 kya sites in Panama for grinding several plant foods including maize and manioc. The abundance of small fish (< 300\u00a0g live weight) that were taken at Zapotal points to the use of tidal traps and weirs in the nearby estuary in order to maximize biomasses.",
            "By 3 kya notable differences had arisen in the material culture of a western region (Greater Chiriqu\u00ed; Chiriqu\u00ed and Bocas del Toro provinces) and a central region (Greater Cocl\u00e9; Cocl\u00e9, Azuero Peninsula and Veraguas provinces). Greater Chiriqu\u00ed shows material culture, art, genes and language that are broadly consistent, in distinction to the Greater Cocl\u00e9 or the even more diverse, but less studied, Greater Dari\u00e9n.",
            "Unique ceremonial and religious precincts stand out in both the Chiriqu\u00ed and Cocl\u00e9 cultural areas, although they are markedly different: Barriles in highland Chiriqu\u00ed, and the twin sites of Sitio Conte and El Ca\u00f1o in the Pacific Cocl\u00e9 lowlands. The ceremonial site at Barriles consists of low platforms, boulder petroglyphs, urn burials, large statues depicting one man sitting on another\u2019s shoulders\u2013in an apparent display of social dominance\u2013and an enormous maize-grinding stone (metate) showing explicit iconographic connections between maize and human fertility. Maize, beans (Phaseolus spp,), and palm and tree fruits characterize the samples of carbonized plant remains in the middens in domestic areas.",
            "The Barriles ceremonial precinct seems to have served many communities located between 1,000 and 2,300\u00a0m above sea level in the shadow of the Bar\u00fa volcano, which last erupted 0.5 kya. It is inferred that Barriles was the initial settlement of a cultural group that first entered this highland zone from elsewhere ca 2.8 kya. Friction led to fission. A sector of the colonizing population moved to Cerro Punta and henceforth maintained vacillating relations with its ancestors (\u201cpeace, trade, war\u201d). Communion among the entire descent group was not severed. Periodically, perhaps annually, festivals were held at ancestral Barriles. The feats of the founders and supernatural helpers were celebrated. Large quantities of alcoholic beverages (e.g., maize and palm sap) were likely brewed.",
            "The well-studied heritage of Greater Cocl\u00e9, which reached its apogee at the great ceremonial and burial precincts of Sitio Conte and El Ca\u00f1o 1.5\u20130.95 kya, confirms a continuity of iconography and symbolism on decorated pottery from 2.5 kya until two decades after Spanish conquest in this central region. But whether this area was also linguistically united cannot yet be determined.",
            "Cultural geography becomes even more complex in the Greater Dari\u00e9n area extending from the El Valle Pleistocene volcano to eastern Dari\u00e9n. Historians and most archaeologists agree that by 1,500 CE the eastern region, and possibly much of the central area, was inhabited by speakers of the Cueva language. Historian Kathleen Romoli and linguists Jacob Loewen and Adolfo Costenla have proposed for many years that the group of settlements that at the time of Spanish conquest spoke the \u201clanguage of Cueva\u201d were not an \u201cethnic group\u201d but, rather, a collection of settlements that shared the Cueva language as a lingua franca. These three researchers also argue that some polities in fact spoke variants of languages in the Chocoan family, especially those on the Pacific side of the Isthmus. Chibchan languages probably derive from a proto-language that coalesced about 10 kya in a \u201ccore area\u201d on the lower Central American Isthmus (southern Costa Rica and western central Panama). Ever since conducted an isozyme-based study of modern Central American Indigenous polities that spoke languages in the Nuclear Chibchan family, it has been apparent that this population coalesced very early in the Holocene and at the onset of agriculture gradually experienced in situ fission and fusion.",
            "Ceramics found in eastern Panama point to greater proximity to the Greater Cocl\u00e9 tradition than a putative Gran Dari\u00e9n cultural sphere among the peoples who inhabited this region from 200 BCE to 1200 CE. Recent findings on the Pearl Islands archipelago confirm the expansion of the ceramic style known as Cubit\u00e1, as well as molded and incised variations of the Conte style, both from the central region of Gran Cocl\u00e9 in the gulf of Panam\u00e1. Biese had already suggested that this expansion reached Panam\u00e1 Viejo, where he reported examples of the Conte style excavated around Puente del Rey, toward the north of the site.",
            "At the Miraflores site on the Banks of the Bayano River, 670\u20131015 CE and 700\u20131030 CE according to the latest 2 sigma calibrations, only one piece made in the region exhibited painted decorations with obvious influences from Greater Cocl\u00e9: a plate with a tripod pedestal with the effigy of a monkey. The same pattern of cultural replacement is documented on the Pearl Islands archipelago, where the islands\u2019 Fifth Ceramic Horizon is identified from 750 through 1350 CE. This late ceramic configuration, which features incised decoration and molding procedures different from its immediate precedents, is that which archaeologists normally associate with Greater Darien, the region that sixteenth-century Spanish chroniclers described as populated by communities that spoke the \u201cCueva language\u201d from Urab\u00e1 to the eastern slope of the El Valle volcano.",
            " argue that the discrepancy between the Greater Darien and Greater Cocl\u00e9 cultural areas, whose geographical extension may have shifted over time, could derive from a change in the population inhabiting the Pearl Islands archipelago: the group using Cubit\u00e1 ceramics and Conte variations may have ceded before the entry of a population with a very different ceramic tradition from the Darien region and related to northwest Colombia. Another hypothesis relates the changes observed to a reorganization of the commercial routes and exchanges from 500 CE, which intensified after 800-900 CE, with the introduction of metallurgy to the isthmus and the replacement of shell artifacts with those of gold to represent high social status. From at least the beginning of the common era through the end of its first millennia, the dispersion of Cubit\u00e1 ceramics allude to the fact that the Pearl Islands archipelago, the Azuero Peninsula and the central coast of the bay of Panama participated in the same sphere of social interaction. This relationship changed completely in the subsequent period, and until European contact.",
            "The uneven impact of European colonization and the upheaval it induced, in addition to subsequent migrations, show that comprehensive and detailed studies of this time period need to be completed in this region to help trace population histories of Indigenous groups before and after 1500 CE. Although goods also crossed the isthmus in pre-colonial times, the process intensified after the early sixteenth century, when the Spanish established settlements on both sides of the Isthmus to forge a highway for the global transit (and often forced mobility) of persons and goods between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.",
            "Ancient Individuals and archaeological information",
            "In order to assess change and continuity in the most radically transformed area of the Isthmus, the under-studied eastern region, 20 ancient individuals (21 specimens in total, sometimes referred as ancient Panamanians for the sake of clarity) were collected from seven different archaeological excavations (six of these within today\u2019s Patronato Panam\u00e1 Viejo, and one at nearby Coco del Mar) (Figure\u00a01A; Table S1). Based on the style of the ceramics recovered, archaeologists consider the area related to contiguous contemporary settlements as part of an extended pre-Hispanic presence of Cueva-speakers within the Greater Darien cultural region. This population coexisted and mixed with Spanish settlers from 1519 to 1541 Common Era (CE), as an Indigenous presence among Old Panama\u2019s earliest Christian burials suggests. The excavations sampled took place in and near Panam\u00e1 Viejo, the site of the colonial city from 1519 through 1671 CE, and an area of pre-Hispanic occupation before that.",

We retained only reads with mapping quality higher than 30 and nucleotides with base quality greater than 20. Moreover, we filtered for sites with a minimum depth of 5X. Then, we remapped to the rebuilt consensus sequence only the reads that mapped uniquely to the mitochondrial reference sequence. We used mafft to align our consensus sequence to a panel of 311 worldwide mtDNA sequences, representing potential contaminant sequences.

These characteristics might influence mapping scores in low-coverage ancient genomes, particularly for those reconstructed from very short reads, eventually leading to an artificial decrement of reads carrying alternative alleles, in comparison to high-coverage modern genomes. In order to verify that this issue did not affect our downstream analyses, we compared the alternative allele frequency distributions between modern and ancient individual data. We used the PLINK 2.0 toolset to calculate the average proportion of alternative alleles for each individual.

For this reason, the 97.5-percentile of population IBD for each population was used as threshold for exclusion.

A further ADMIXTURE analysis (Figure\u00a0S2B) was performed projecting the ancient individuals on to the population structure from only modern individuals using the option -P and the .P file from the analysis in Figure\u00a0S2A at K14.",
            "Admixture tests (f statistics)",
            "The f statistics was performed using EIGENSOFT v7.2 and AdmixTools v4.1. Outgroup f3 was used to highlight only the shared genetic history between individuals or populations relative to an outgroup. A high f3 value means more genetic history shared between the pair population analyzed. This method is less sensitive to lineage-specific genetic drift over the use of pairwise distance measures, such as Fst. A graphic explanation of the outgroup f3 is reported in Figure\u00a0S3.",
            "We analyzed the shared genetic history of modern IA populations (included in the mIA417 and uIA89 datasets) against some ancient reference genomes (aRG) from Siberia, Beringia, North America (representative of the NNA ancestry) and South America (representative of SNA). The Guna always show a shared genetic drift with the ancient reference individuals lower than the average f3 value (dotted line) of all modern IA groups. It could be also noticed that the average f3 value is higher in the comparison with Spirit Cave than with Anzick-1.",
            "We also built a distance matrix using the inverse values derived from the outgroup f3 statistics on all Central and South American populations pairs plus Anzick-1, Early San Nicolas (ESN), Spirit Cave and USR-1 (as an outgroup). We retained only populations with more than 30K overlapping SNPs and significant Z scores (p value\u223c0.001, for Z scores > |3.3|) in all comparisons. This distance matrix was used to generate a neighbor joining tree (Figure\u00a0S3C) with the program PHYLIP 3.6. The tree was visualized with FigTree 1.4.4 (https://github.com/rambaut/figtree).",
            "The f4 statistics was eventually used to identify gene flows among different populations. The comparison was performed in the form f4(W, X; Y/test, Outgroup), as reported in the software documentation. A graphic explanation of the f4 statistics analyses is reported in Figure\u00a0S5. In each figure showing a f4 statistics test the form is reported above the plot(s). Results from f4 analyses presented in Figure\u00a02C display only tests in which the initial conformation of the tree is rejected (p\u223c0.001, Z score > 3.3 or\u00a0< \u22123.3), meaning that the investigated population (Y) has a significantly higher genetic affinity with W rather than with X if the f4 results are positive, the opposite when values are negative. If the results are not displayed, the proposed tree cannot be rejected and there are no significant preferential relationships between the test population (Y) and W or X. In Figure\u00a0S5 the Z score is displayed in abscissa and the region where the tested tree cannot be rejected is highlighted in gray (see above).",
            "In all f4 statistics, we considered a minimum threshold of 30K SNPs, the comparisons with less SNPs are highlighted with a specific symbol (X). Due to the low number of SNPs retained in multiple analyses, the following individuals were excluded: Baja_100, CuevadelPerico_2700, Enoque_3500, Kaillachuro_4000, LosIndios_600, Moraes_5800, SanFranciscoBay_25, ShukaKaa_10300, SoroMikayaPatjxa_6800 and Tibes_1200.",
            "In particular, to specifically check for the relationships between Anzick-1 and Spirit Cave, with the Isthmian populations as well as with other ancient and modern IA individuals from Central and South America, we ran two f4statistics in the following forms f4 (Anzick-1, Spirit Cave; Isthmo, Mbuti) and f4 (Anzick-1, Spirit Cave; Central and South IA, Mbuti). The datasets uIA89, mIA417 and ancient individuals were used considering different sets of variants: all SNPs, all SNPs without C to T and G to A variants, only transversions and only transversion with ancient individuals\u2019 coverage downsampled to a maximum of 1X (to avoid coverage biases).",
            "We observed a clear pattern that becomes significant when increasing the number of SNPs. We further verified this pattern using a f4 statistics in the form f4 (USR-1, Anzick-1/Spirit Cave; Central and South IA, Mbuti) that confirmed a higher proximity to Spirit Cave in comparison to Anzick-1. The same pattern has been also observed in the outgroup f3 analyses (see above).",

This pattern is more evident in the Guna, the best representative of the Isthmo-Colombian component. This pattern confirms that a different ancestry, instead of only genetic drift by isolation, is needed to explain the distinctiveness of the Isthmo-Colombian populations.",
            "Demographic modeling with qpGraph",
            "We used qpGraph, on a merged dataset of the uIA89, mIA417 and ancient individuals (considering only transversions), to reconstruct the best tree modeling the relationships between Isthmian populations and ancient Indigenous genomes. In our f4 statistics we noted a differential relationship between Isthmian groups and modern/ancient Indigenous Americans in comparison to the individuals older than 10 kya (Figure\u00a06A; Table S4). Therefore, we modeled a basal tree with three of the most ancient available genomes of the SNA ancestry, an ancestry that certainly went through the Isthmus to reach South America. Our best tree revealed that the SNA dispersal involved a complex demographic pattern, with three possible ancestries (Figure\u00a0S6A). To resolve the inferred zero-length internal branch, we tested all three possible split orders obtaining similar scores. Therefore, it might represent a very short branch that we cannot resolve with this dataset power and the three lineages, Anzick-1 (Montana, \u223c12.6 kya), Lagoa Santa (Brazil, \u223c10.4 kya; SNA1) and Spirit Cave (Nevada, \u223c10.9 kya; SNA2) are statistically consistent with forming a trifurcation. The best fitting topology was tested by considering an early admixture between the SNA2 source and SNA1 obtaining a still supported model without zero-length branches (Figure\u00a0S6B). To increase the resolution power and considering the results of previous analyses (f3- and f4-statistics), we added to this graph the captured and genotyped data from Lapa do Santos (Brazil, \u223c9.6 kya) as SNA1 and the whole-genome sequences of ESN (California; \u223c4-5 kya) as SNA2. This allowed us also to check for any bias due to sequencing methods. Even in this case the best fit tree confirms the trifurcation (Figure\u00a0S6C). After this step, we added Los Rieles (Chile, \u223c10.9 kya), the most ancient Pacific coast genome, which turned out to be better modeled as an admixture of SNA1 and SNA2 (|Z|\u00a0= 2.835) than as non-admixed and considering only geographic origins (|Z|\u00a0= 3.930) (Figure\u00a0S6D). This finding confirms that both SNA1 and SNA2 reached South America and seems to indicate that the latter had a lower impact on the Atlantic side of South America. When Los Rieles is replaced by Lapa do Santos, the tree does not fit (|Z|\u00a0= 3.930) (Figure\u00a0S6E).",
            "We then took into account that, in the f4 statistics (Figure\u00a06A; Table S4), there is a significant allele sharing of the Isthmian populations with Spirit Cave and two Central American ancient genomes, Mayahak Cab Pek (Belize, \u223c9.3 kya) and Saki Tzul (Belize, \u223c7.4 kya), as well as a higher genetic proximity to Los Rieles relative to Lagoa Santa. Therefore, we attempted to model ancient Panama in relation to these ancient genomes (Figures S6F and S6G). Ancient Panama fits better when considering an admixture between the Central-South American branch of SNA2 and another ancestry parallel to SNA2 and shows the best score with Mayahak Cab Pek (Figure\u00a0S6G). The additions of NNA individuals (Figure\u00a0S6H), ASO (Ancient Southwestern Ontario, \u223c4.2 kya), 939 (Lucy Island, British Columbia, \u223c6.1 kya), Kennewick (Washington State, \u223c8.8 kya), ancient Athabaskan (dated 100 and 725 ya), and modern Chipewyan, hold better when assuming some admixture events involving these genomes. These findings confirm that we cannot identify an unadmixed proxy for the NNA ancestry among ancient individuals. The best graph was obtained when including ASO as NNA and Mayahak Cab Pek as the central American ancient genome.",
            "At this point, we further evaluated the relationship of Panama with SNA1 that we initially linked to Lagoa Santa (Figure\u00a0S6A). As before, we started from basal admixture graphs without Guna and considered the conformation with ASO and Mayahak Cab Pek, based on previous results (Figure\u00a0S6H). We first tested the tree without admixture in Los Rieles, placing Lagoa Santa as a parallel branch of SNA2, but the tree would fit only when considering Los Rieles as an admixture between SNA1 and SNA2 (|Z|\u00a0= 2.896), the two early South American ancestries that we identified above (Figure\u00a0S7A). It is worth mentioning, however, that the graph without admixture in Los Rieles became statistically significant (|Z|\u00a0< 3) when Lagoa Santa was replaced with the younger Laranjal sample (Brazil, \u223c6.8 kya) (Figure\u00a0S7B). This confirms our f4 statistics (Figure\u00a06A; Table S4) and the scenario of a widespread population turnover in South American during mid-Holocene, as previously suggested, a finding that also correlates with climate changes in the southern continent. As for the Ancient Panamanians, they are a mix between the source of SNA2 (prior to Spirit Cave) and the admixture between SNA1 and SNA2 (Figure\u00a0S7A).",
            "Lastly, we assessed different admixture graphs also including the Guna, which was the best representative of the Isthmian-specific component in our previous analyses (Figure\u00a02A). As for the ancient Isthmians, we first explored the link of Guna with SNA2 (i.e., Spirit Cave) and in this setting only the admixed model was supported, with the Guna group representing a still unsampled population of the Isthmus, UPopI (Figure\u00a0S7B). To assess if UPopI might correspond to the previously identified UPopA, we replaced Guna with Mixe, previously used to identify UPopA. The resulting admixture graph was not statistically supported (|Z| > 3, the rightmost graph). Then, we linked Guna also to SNA1, obtaining the best Z score in the graph when UPopI was placed as a parallel ancestry to SNA1 and SNA2, all radiating from the same early SNA source (Figure\u00a0S7C). The latter derives from an initial split of the early Indigenous group into SNA and NNA. In this scenario the ASO group is the result of an admixture between NNA and SNA1. It is therefore likely that the first split occurred further north and earlier than the diversification of SNA into SNA1 e SNA2. Finally, the same graph shows that when UPopI reached the Isthmian area, it admixed locally with population groups derived from both SNA1 and SNA2.",
            "Taking into account the presence of a zero-length internal branch in the final tree with UPopI (Figure\u00a0S7C) and the results obtained on the basal graph (Figure\u00a0S6), we modeled a binary tree without zero-length branches when considering an initial migration of population with an early SNA ancestry (SNA1) and a later North American admixture between SNA1 and a different SNA branch (SNA2) (Figure\u00a07). This admixture gave rise to two ancestries, one, related to Spirit Cave, that reached South America, leaving evident footprints on the Pacific coast, and another restricted to the Isthmo-Colombian area (UPopI) that is well represented in the Guna. The best topologies were also checked replacing Guna (UPopI) with Mixe (UPopA), Spirit Cave with Anzick-1, and without UPopI (Figures S7D\u2013S7F), but no statistically supported graphs were found. The other Isthmian Indigenous groups were also tested (replacing ancient Isthmians) using this final model (Z score always\u00a0< 2.5) to estimate the differential legacy of the three ancestries in present-day populations (inset of Figure\u00a07).",

            "The local ancestry for genomic fragments in the American individuals was estimated using RFMix. As source populations, we used Bantu, Esan (ESN), Gambia (GWDwg), Mandenka, Mbuti and Yoruba (YRI) for Africa, Spanish (IBS), British (GBR), French, Icelandic and Tuscany (TSI) for Europe and Chipewyan, Kichwa Orellana, PaGUNA, Puno, Surui and Karitiana for Indigenous ancestry. We used \u201cPopPhased,\u201d \u201c-n 5\u201d and \u201c\u2013forward-backward\u201d options as recommended in RFMix manual. Then, starting from RFMix output files, we built a PLINK file set in which the non-Indigenous SNPs were masked. The masking process was done with this rationale: if in the \u201cViterbi\u201d output a particular SNP was not assigned to the Indigenous ancestry and if the probability of belonging to the Indigenous ancestry (reported in the \u201cforwardbackward\u201d output) was less than a threshold (< 0.9) that allele was set as missing.

Technically for this analysis the recombination (-n) and mutation (-m) parameters used were respectively 233.1352 and 0.00084 estimated on five randomly selected chromosomes (3, 7, 10, 18 and 22). Since the genetic variability among IA populations is low, we ran CHROMOPAINTER in two runs, one with standard parameters, the other adding the flag -k 50. No significant differences were observed between the two runs.",

The MCMC file (.xml) was used to build the tree structure using both the options \u2013T1 and \u2013T3, without major changes between the two methods.",
            "Initially, we obtained 50 clusters in the final tree (data not shown). However, to obtain more robust genetic inferences the number of clusters was reduced to 19 considering the number of individuals in each cluster (less than five) and the Total Variation Distance (TVD\u00a0< 0.03) as elimination criteria. TVD is an index that measures the similarity between copying vectors of the CHROMOPAINTER matrix (calculated on the chunklengths); lower values of TVD mean similarity, while higher values indicate heterogeneity.",
            "Haplotype Analyses on \u2018Masked\u2019 Individuals",
            "The masked haplotypes (mIA417) were initially filtered for the individuals that had a maximum of 50% of missing SNPs (considered as the mean of the summed missingness of the two haplotypes) and, among these individuals, we selected only those with at least 25% of SNPs retained in each haplotype. Eventually, we obtained a restricted dataset of 311 masked individuals (rmIA311). This dataset (rmIA311) was then converted in PLINK1.9 format and subsequently in a CHROMOPAINTERv2 input. To enable missing data in CHROMOPAINTERv2, we slightly modified CHROMOPAINTERv2 such that a recipient/target\u2019s emission probability is set to 0 at missing (i.e., masked) SNPs when tabulating the expected number of segments matched to each \u201cDonor\u201d individual that the recipient is compared to. Therefore, in regions of high missingness the expected number of segments matched to each \u201cDonor\u201d will tend toward the prior, which assumes equal matching to all \u201cDonor\u201d individuals. However, in our application here we found that inference seems to be dominated by data at non-missing SNPs, where the usual CHROMOPAINTERv2 machinery is employed. In particular, we did not identify any correlation between the percentage of missing data (even when reaching 50%) and bad placements/outlier behaviors in the PCA created from the CHROMOPAINTER output projecting the \u2018masked\u2019 individuals (Figure\u00a0S4A).",

            "The pattern of IBD sharing within each population of the uIA217 phased dataset was analyzed using Refined-IBD, which makes it possible to improve the accuracy and efficiency of identity by descent detection in population data, using default parameters. The average IBD-sharing was calculated for nine different bin categories corresponding to different degrees of relatedness. The total length of shared IBD was calculated for each bin, by considering all pairs of individuals within each population group. The summed length was then divided by the numbers of pairs in each population in order to obtain the average total length of intrapopulation IBD shared blocks for each population in the uIA217 dataset (y axis in Figure\u00a03C).",
            "In order to reconstruct the population dynamics, we applied IBDne on the uIA217 dataset, using both IBDseq, which does not require phased data, and Refined-IBD that uses phased data, using different minimum thresholds of IBD segment length (2 and 4 centimorgan, cM). Considering all the Panamanian individuals, lower confidence intervals were obtained when using windows of 2 cM. Moreover, the Ne obtained with Refined-IBD is more compatible with historical estimates of the area\u2019s pre-colonial population size (see introduction). We observed the same trend in the ancestry-specific effective population size (asIBDne) from the 74 Panamanian individuals, masked for the IA component, following the pipeline presented by, as reported in. Therefore, Refined-IBD was applied using 2 cM windows for the comparison between Panamanian and non-Panamanian IA individuals present in the uIA217 dataset (inset Figure\u00a03C). This analysis shows a decrease in the region\u2019s population size that pre-dates the average values of other IA populations considered together. This decrease started in pre-Hispanic times (\u223c1100 ya) then became steeper in the early colonial period (\u223c500 ya). To retain more information, we used the three macro-clusters from the fineSTRUCTURE tree: Guna (30 individuals), Ember\u00e1 (18 individuals) and Western Panama (20 individuals) encompassing Bribri, Naso and Ng\u00e4be. The Guna group shows a peculiar trend when considering shorter IBD fragments\u00a0< 6 cM (Figure\u00a0S4C). However, even when the Guna were removed from the Panamanian / non-Panamanian comparison, the peculiar pre-Hispanic demographic contraction of the Panamanian populations was still detectable and with smaller confidence intervals (Figure\u00a0S4D). The same approach was applied including all of the macro-clusters obtained with fineSTRUCTURE and considering a minimum threshold of 8 cM. This analysis confirmed the behavior of the Isthmian groups including the Guna (Figure\u00a0S4E).",

            "In order to date the admixture events between our Panamanian groups and other IA populations included in the uIA217 dataset, we calculated the IBD sharing segments using RefineIBD as performed by. The IBD blocks were divided into three categories, based on their length (1-5 cM, 5-10 cM and over 10 cM), each roughly representing different time periods: 1,500-2,500 ya, 500-1,500 ya and\u00a0< 500 ya. We have calculated the mean of summed IBD lengths shared between population pairs for each length category. To reduce noise and false positives only the pairs that shared at least two blocks > 5 cM and four\u00a0< 5 cM were considered.",

            "Late Danubian mitochondrial genomes shed light into the Neolithisation of Central Europe in the 5th millennium BC",
            "ABSTRACT",
            "Background",
            "Recent aDNA studies are progressively focusing on various Neolithic and Hunter - Gatherer (HG) populations, providing arguments in favor of major migrations accompanying European Neolithisation. The major focus was so far on the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), which introduced the Neolithic way of life in Central Europe in the second half of 6th millennium BC. It is widely agreed that people of this culture were genetically different from local HGs and no genetic exchange is seen between the two groups. From the other hand some degree of resurgence of HGs genetic component is seen in late Neolithic groups belonging to the complex of the Funnel Beaker Cultures (TRB). Less attention is brought to various middle Neolithic cultures belonging to Late Danubian sequence which chronologically fall in between those two abovementioned groups. We suspected that genetic influx from HG to farming communities might have happened in Late Danubian cultures since archaeologists see extensive contacts between those two communities.",
            "Results",
            "Here we address this issue by presenting 5 complete mitochondrial genomes of various late Danubian individuals from modern-day Poland and combining it with available published data. Our data show that Late Danubian cultures are maternally closely related to Funnel Beaker groups instead of culturally similar LBK.",
            "Conclusions",
            "We assume that it is an effect of the presence of individuals belonging to U5 haplogroup both in Late Danubians and the TRB. The U5 haplogroup is thought to be a typical for HGs of Europe and therefore we argue that it is an additional evidence of genetic exchange between farming and HG groups taking place at least as far back as in middle Neolithic, in the Late Danubian communities.",

            "INTRO",
            "Background",
            "The Danubian Neolithic is a sequence of archaeological cultures that emerged around 5600/5500 BC in the Transdanubia region of western Hungary from the preceding Vinca, Starcevo and K\u00f6ros cultures. The Neolithisation of Central Europe by people of the Linear Pottery Culture, better known as the Linearbandkeramik culture (LBK), is a well-investigated phenomenon, both archaeologically and genetically. Nowadays it is agreed by both archaeologists and geneticists that the rapid spread of the LBK in the second half of 6th millennium BC was one of the major migration events that shaped the European gene pool.",
            "The archaeologists see the LBK as one of the stages of migration process originating in Near East, that spread north- and west-wards gradually introducing the Neolithic way of life in Europe. However some archaeological data also points to involvement of local Hunter-Gatherers (HGs) in the formation of the LBK and its eastern variant the Alf\u00f6ld Linear Pottery (ALP) culture from Star\u010dcevo and K\u00f6r\u00f6s cultures. The relatively rapid pace of the spread of the LBK in Central Europe in the second half of 6th millennium BC, together with different, in comparison with local HG groups, economy and material culture, is being interpreted as an evidence of migratory character of this movement. Based on archaeological data it has been suggested that LBK populations either replaced the pre-existing HG populations or, alternatively, coexisted with them utilizing different resources and areas. However some degree of contact between sites representing both the LBK and HG context is observed in form of exchange of goods such as lithic resources. The LBK presence in Central Europe lasted for around four hundred years, and throughout this period it remained seemingly unchanged maintaining its economic, cultural and social character. In the first half of 5th millennium BC this homogenous culture differentiated into several distinctive cultures belonging to late Danubian sequence (LDN in our paper). Those new cultural entities include: Grossgartach, R\u00f6ssen, Stroke-ornamented ware culture (StBK), Late Band Pottery Culture (LBPC), Malice, and Lengyel cultures, and are found in more diverse set of ecological zones compared to the LBK. They also display a changing socioeconomic organization of their communities. In some regions, notably in the northern part of former LBK occupation, large stable settlements were replaced by small and short-lived sites with late Danubian archaeological assemblages, located on sandy-soils occupied earlier by local HG. The post-LBK period\u2014the first 400\u2013500 years after the end of the LBK\u2014in all the main regions of the Polish lowlands marked a complete disintegration of the preceding LBK arrangements and the discontinuous development of new forms of spatial organization. The changes are thought by archaeologists, to originate from internal social dynamics of those communities, although they allowed for more extensive contacts with HG groups in later period. The second half of 5th millennium BC marks the emergence of the final groups belonging to the Danubian Neolithic, with the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Group being the prominent example in the Polish lowlands. Archaeologists see these final stages of Linear Pottery cultures as a synthesis of various elements, including those of local HG both in terms of economy and material culture. The end of Danubian sequence is marked by another widespread phenomenon known as the Funnel Beaker Culture (TRB, from Trichterbecherkultur). This new entity emerged almost simultaneously along Baltic Coast and in the Kuyavia region in the end of the 5th millennium BC. The TRB is sometimes called Northern Europe\u2019s first autochthonous farming population; however the idea is being disputed as early TRB exhibits very few Mesolithic elements in their archaeological record. Moreover, since it was partially contemporaneous with the LDN sequence, the emergence of the TRB as a result of divergence of linear cultures, strengthened by different interregional contacts, cannot be excluded.",
            "Geneticists have been trying to directly address questions related to the origins and spread of Neolithic populations in Central Europe. The investigation of hypervariable region (HVR) of mitochondrial (mt) DNA from LBK individuals from present-day Germany, Austria and Hungary, led researchers to propose the N1a, later supplemented by T2, J, K, V and HV as a \u2018signature haplogroups\u2019 of the LBK, as they were found in relatively high frequencies in early farmers in comparison to HG and modern European populations. By contrast haplogroups U2, U4, U5 and U8 have been found to dominate in European HG populations differentiating them from LBK communities. Further data from LBK populations, (including ALP) and their predecessors Star\u010devo and K\u00f6r\u00f6s cultures, show similar haplogroup patterns to that reported for the LBK alone, pointing to genetic uniformity of linear cultures and lack of HG genetic involvement in their formation.",
            "The genomic data supported the idea about lack of genetic continuity between the LBK and the local Hunter - Gathers. However, the LDN populations such as the R\u00f6ssen culture have received less attention and are often merged and/or analyzed together with data from individuals from LBK contexts. The contacts between Danubian and HG communities that led to gradual change of their economy and material culture seen by archaeologists seem to have no impact on the genetic composition of both communities. However, sparse occurrences of typical HG haplogroups found in late Danubian populations, indicate that some degree of genetic influx occurred between those populations. The samples coming from the TRB complex also were the focus of the researches, who found out that they genetically differed slightly from LBK individuals, with whole genome data showing higher HG component in the TRB.",
            "The main aim of our study was to analyze genetic affinities of LDN populations looking for potential genomic influx from HGs. We generated complete mt genomes from individuals belonging to LBK and late Danubian contexts excavated in modern-day Poland and combined these data with available partial and complete ancient European mt genomes to investigate haplogroup differences between LBK, its successors from the LDN sequence, Central European Hunter-Gatherers and other post-Danubian populations.",

Additionally, one Mesolithic individual from Janis\u0142awice in central Poland was included. Detailed archaeological information for all the individuals can be found in supplementary material (Additional file 1: Supplementary Text S1 and Additional file 2: Table S1).",

Before DNA extraction, teeth and bone fragments were cleaned with 5% NaOCl and rinsed three times with sterile water followed by UV irradiation for at least two hours per each side. After UV exposure, the samples were drilled using Dremel\u00ae drill bits and ~250\u00a0mg of teeth/bone powder was collected to sterile screw cap tubes (2\u00a0ml).

            "Pairwise genetic distances were computed in the Arlequin 3.5 software using the complete mitochondrial genomes of the ancient individuals. To reduce the chance of incorporating erroneous SNPs, we have trimmed the first and last 30 nucleotides from all of the consensus mtDNA sequences, because these regions were ambiguously sequenced in some reference data. We computed Nei\u2019s average number of pairwise differences between the populations with 1000 permutations and p-value of 0.05 and used its linearized form.",

In the Arlequin 3.5 package, the AMOVA was computed from the pairwise FST matrix (10 000 permutations). This test was primarily used to infer the affiliation of populations into broader defined clusters of populations. AMOVA was used to assess the likelihood that any of the other cultures was a continuous population with LDN, a total of 8 population structures were tested. LDN was grouped consecutively with one from the other 7 populations (HG, LBK, TRB, NEN, CWC, BBC, YAM) while remaining 6 populations were kept separately (Additional file 2: Table S6).",

Following, the network construction procedure included weighting the most common mutations inversely according to their frequency. The batches of most frequent polymorphisms were assigned reduced weights using in-house script (deposited at https://github.com/EdaEhler/bioutils_python) in the following manner: the most frequent polymorphism (or group of polymorphisms) was given the weight of 1, the second most common polymorphism was given the weight of 2, the third most common polymorphism was given the weight of 3, etc. up to 10. All remaining polymorphic loci retained the default weight of 10.

From the remaining samples, 8 more libraries that produced at least 25 mitochondrial fragments were selected for the mtDNA enrichment process. The average mitochondrial genome coverage after capture varied between 2 and 113 and therefore we could determine the haplogroups for 4 more of the samples. New mitochondrial genomes published in this study, together with partial genome from Jan1 individual are presented in Table\u00a01. Additional information on sequencing and enrichment efficiency can be found in Additional file 2: Table S4. ",
            "The nucleotide misincorporation patterns of the mitochondrial sequences were assessed using the mapDamage software and showed fragment length distribution and the deamination patterns characteristic for aDNA: C to T transitions accumulated at 5\u2032\u00a0ends and corresponding G to A transitions at 3\u2032 ends of DNA fragments (Additional file 3: Figure S1). The contamination estimates acquired with Schmutzi software supported this result as in all samples they were below 4% (Additional file 2: Table S4). In total, we acquired 5 new mitochondrial genomes for Danubian Cultures from contemporary Polish lands: 1 from the LBK and 4 from LDN Lengyel and Malice Cultures and partial genome from HG individual from Janis\u0142awice. All genomes are deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KY091894-KY091898.

            "The PCA plot of the two first principal components, describing 29.4 and 24.5% variability respectively (Fig.\u00a03), shows that LDN samples are in close vicinity of other early and middle Neolithic samples, however further from the LBK than expected. Instead LDN is much closer to some populations belonging to the TRB complex, i.e. Salzm\u00fcnde (SMC) and Baalberg (BAC) cultures. It is also in direct proximity to Middle Neolithic Spain (MNS), Gurgy (GRG) and Treilles (TRS) populations. The k-means clustering always grouped the LDN within a cluster of middle Neolithic cultures, including the MNS, GRG and BAC. Depending on k - value the composition of this cluster changed but it always contained the LDN, LBK and BAC populations. Figure\u00a03 shows the combined results of PCA with color coding according to clustering with k value of 6. The displayed PCA loadings show that the most influential haplogroups having effect on PCA scores, are U4, U5a, U5b, U2, T2, K, and H. ",

            "The median network generated for U5 haplotypes show that haplotypes belonging to U5b found in early to late Neolithic communities from Central Europe, including LDN U5b1b haplotype discovered in this study, all originate from various Central European HG haplotypes (Fig.\u00a06). ",

            "Discussion",
            "Our data indicate close relation of the LDN to various middle and late Neolithic populations, especially those belonging to the TRB complex. This stands in contradiction to suggestions that late Danubian populations should be in closest genetic relation to the LBK, the notion previously suggested by both archaeologists and geneticists. Our results also contradicts the hypothesis, that TRB groups belonged to a different tradition than the Danubian sequence, and that they had other, possibly local Mesolithic, origins. Instead our data support the idea that through their long presence in Central Europe, the Danubian populations gradually differentiated from groups associated with the LBK culture into a sequence of populations belonging to various LDN populations, and that some of those populations in turn were driving the emergence of the TRB.",
            "The majority of the haplotypes from LDN populations, acquired by us and in other studies, are considered to be typical for the LBK. However, several of them belong to U5b and U5a haplogroup which is thought to be a part of HG component of the European gene pool. The relatively similar frequency of U5b haplogroup, found in populations belonging to both the LDN and the TRB complex seems to be responsible for drawing them closer together in our analyses. The haplogroups U5b and U5a are considered to belong to Hunter-Gatherer component of European gene-pool. The origin of U5b in TRB populations from modern-day Germany is being interpreted as an increase in Hunter-Gatherer mt lineages in middle Neolithic, a view supported by whole genome data. Likewise, based on whole genomic data, some genetic admixture from Scandinavian HG to northern TRB populations was observed.",
            "Neither PCA nor MDS can directly answer where U5 individuals, differentiating LDN and TRB from LBK, came from, and what was the direction and nature of the gene flow. The Hunter - Gatherers of Central Europe, based on well documented history of contacts between them and LDN communities, seem to be most probable candidate for source of U5 haplotypes. On the other hand, HG populations are also frequently documented to live close to farming communities but maintaining their genetic distance. One can also argue that TRB populations lived in close proximity with late Danubian communities (in particular the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Group and therefore the possibility of a gene flow from the TRB to the LDN should also be taken into consideration.",
            "However, the network analysis shows that both LDN and TRB U5b haplogroups originated from haplotypes found in HG individuals, so the direct gene flow between LDN and TRB groups, based on few available samples, is not supported. Notably, in case of U5b part of the median network all basal (i.e. close to the center of the network) haplotypes belong to Central Europe HG while the haplotypes found in LDN, TRB, LBK, BBC and CWC samples form the outer part of the network, which suggests that they constitute a derived version of haplotypes, with more accumulated substitutions compared to the U5b haplogroups from HG.",
            "Assuming that HG groups were the source of U5 haplotypes in LDN populations it would be interesting to speculate on exact source and nature of this gene flow. The fact that out of four U5 individuals found in LDN populations 3 belong to U5b while one belongs to U5a haplogroup. One possible explanation of this disproportion is the low sample size and the U5a might simply have been missed by our sample. However, what is noteworthy\u00a0the majority of Mesolithic individuals with U5a haplotypes come from outside of Central Europe, most notably from Scandinavia. That stands in contrast with the fact that a majority of cultural exchange, between the LDN and HG, is seen between the LDN and northern HG groups (notably Erteb\u00f8lle culture) and not neighboring lowlands groups (such as Janis\u0142awice culture). Meantime, HG elements seen in the TRB material culture came from various HG backgrounds, both from Baltic see coast, and European lowlands. However, the cultural diversity of European Hunter - Gatherers does not seem to be reflected by their genetic diversity, as they seem to be rather uniform group and therefore differentiating between potential sources of genetic influx to either the LDN or the TRB might be difficult.",
            "The two new U5b haplotypes, recovered in this and our previous study, come from two geographically and chronologically distant sites. U5b2a1a was found in KZ1 female from the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski group of Lengyel Culture. It is dated to 4226\u2009\u00b1\u200974\u00a0cal. BC, and comes from Krusza Zamkowa site, which is known for its rich burials with numerous imports, some stylistically resembling HG artifacts. U5b1b found in the KM1 female excavated in Kazimierza Ma\u0142a site belonged to the Malice Culture dated to around 4800\u20134500 BC. The Malice Culture itself exhibits influences from other linear pottery groups mostly from the Lengyel and Polg\u00e1r cultures south from it. Elements of Hunter-Gatherer origin are not proposed for the Malice Culture itself; however close ties and its possible involvement in formation of the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski group are debated.",
            "Our data, from this and the previous study, shows that in its long existence the LBK gradually changed into the LDN not only in terms of material culture but also in terms of its genetic composition. The change observed by us in form of introduction of U5b haplotypes is most probably the result of gene flow from HG populations. This idea, proposed also for populations from western fringe of LDN populations, pushes back in time the resurgence of HG maternal lineages seen by others in TRB populations. The nature of this flow might be, to some extent, explained by what we know about social and migration behaviors of Danubians. Both isotopic and genetic data have given us some clues about the social organization of early farming communities. Strontium isotope data suggest greater mobility of women than men in some LBK populations, which may indicate patrilocal model of society. The genetic data also points towards patrilocality in Early Neolithic as a most probable cause of differences in mtDNA and Y-chromosome composition of European gene pool. This hypothesis is also strengthened by much higher haplogroup diversity of mtDNA than Y-chromosome DNA observed in the LBK population from Hungary. Similar higher diversity of maternal compared to paternal lineages was found in Neolithic populations that emerged along Mediterranean route of neolithisation. Those results may explain the nature of influx of foreign mitochondrial haplogroups into early farming communities. It seems possible that to some extent it was customary to introduce females from neighboring communities into LBK and LDN groups, with different Hunter-Gatherer groups being the most probable source of this influx. However, to determine that more, both genetic and isotopic data is needed from those populations.",

            "Conclusions",
            "We acquired 5 new complete mitochondrial genomes from Late Danubian populations from modern day Poland. Population genetic analyses run on our data combined with published haplotypes show that Late Danubian populations are maternally closer related to TRB groups instead of culturally similar LBK. We assume that U5 haplotypes found by us and other researchers in those populations are responsible for this affinity. Since U5 is thought to be one of haplogroups characteristic for HG component of European gene pool, we argue that its presence points to gene flow from HG to both Late Danubian and TRB populations.",

            "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a major cause of blindness and results from irreversible retinal ganglion cell damage and optic nerve degeneration. In the United States, POAG is most prevalent in African-Americans. Mitochondrial genetics and dysfunction have been implicated in POAG, and potentially pathogenic sequence variations, in particular novel transversional base substitutions, are reportedly common in mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) from POAG patient blood. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the spectrum of sequence variation in mtDNA from African-American POAG patients and determine whether novel nonsynonymous, transversional or other potentially pathogenic sequence variations are observed more commonly in POAG cases than controls. mtDNA from African-American POAG cases (n = 22) and age-matched controls (n = 22) was analyzed by deep sequencing of a single 16,487 base pair PCR amplicon by Ion Torrent, and candidate novel variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Sequence variants were classified and interpreted using the MITOMAP compendium of polymorphisms. 99.8% of the observed variations had been previously reported. The ratio of novel variants to POAG cases was 7-fold lower than a prior estimate. Novel mtDNA variants were present in 3 of 22 cases, novel nonsynonymous changes in 1 of 22 cases and novel transversions in 0 of 22 cases; these proportions are significantly lower (p<.0005, p<.0004, p<.0001) than estimated previously for POAG, and did not differ significantly from controls. Although it is possible that mitochondrial genetics play a role in African-Americans\u2019 high susceptibility to POAG, it is unlikely that any mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction is due to an abnormally high incidence of novel mutations that can be detected in mtDNA from peripheral blood.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is defined as a spectrum of diseases causing vision loss as a result of progressive and irreversible retinal ganglion cell damage, optic nerve degeneration and corresponding visual field loss. African-Americans are disproportionately affected by POAG. A metaanalysis of 46 observational studies found that POAG prevalence in people over age 70 was 16% for blacks and 6% for whites, and the age-adjusted prevalence rate of POAG in African-Americans is four- to five-fold higher than whites.",
            "Mitochondria are subcellular organelles descended from an ancient bacterial endosymbiont. They are responsible for energy metabolism based on oxidative phosphorylation, and play a central role in apoptosis and tissue homeostasis. Although supported and regulated by ~1,500 nuclear genes, human mitochondria possess their own genome, mtDNA, a circular molecule of 16,549 base pairs encoding 22 tRNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs and protein components of the electron transfer chain. mtDNA variants and haplogroups have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Mutations in mtDNA may result in degeneration of the optic nerve: a nonsynonymous mitochondrial mutation was first identified as the cause of Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Inheritance of human mtDNA is exclusively maternal, and all humans can trace their maternal ancestry back to a single African woman, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA), who lived 194,300 +/- 32,550 years ago. Sequence variants in mtDNA have accumulated in a manner proportional to divergence time, giving rise to distinct collections of ancestral variants, \u201chaplogroups\u201d, that reflect humanity\u2019s African genesis and patterns of global migration. African mitochondrial haplogroups have been linked to elevated risk for POAG in Saudi patients.",
            "Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial genetics and function might play a role in POAG pathogenesis. For example, a maternal family history of POAG is more likely than a paternal one, as would be expected from mitochondrial genetics: mothers and sisters of glaucoma patients were more likely to have glaucoma than fathers and brothers. The loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) is characteristic of POAG, and RGC have a high energy requirement, which may make them especially vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction. A mitochondrial complex-I defect has been proposed as a mechanism for the loss of trabecular meshwork cells in POAG, which were found to have higher levels of reactive oxygen species and to be more sensitive to mitochondrial inhibition than normal cells; treatment with antioxidants or mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitors might inhibit disease progression. Lymphocytes of POAG patients were reported to have significantly lower mean mitochondrial respiratory activity, and POAG lymphoblast cell lines were recently found to have a complex-I ATP synthesis defect. Finally, 52% of Saudi POAG cases were found to harbor novel potentially pathogenic nonsynonymous changes in mtDNA from blood and 63% of POAG cases were found to have novel and unusual transversional (purine <-> pyrimidine) nucleotide substitutions. It was hypothesized that somatic mtDNA transversions were generated in response to oxidative stress in early development or throughout life, contributing to optic nerve injury in POAG.",
            "The mitochondrial mutations implicated in LHON have been examined in POAG patients, but do not appear to be significant risk factors, although one study of Japanese patients found 5 LHON-associated mitochondrial mutations in 551 cases, vs. none in 284 controls. One investigation failed to find an association between mtDNA haplotypes and POAG, but included only subjects from European populations. A study of 176 Saudi POAG patients and 186 controls found that individuals with African mtDNA haplotypes were at higher risk for developing glaucoma, whereas a Eurasian mtDNA haplogroup may have a mild protective effect. However, a study of Ghanaian patients concluded that mtDNA haplogroups did not confer susceptibility to POAG.",
            "Mitochondrial sequence variation in POAG has not been examined in an African-American population. The objective of this study was to determine the numbers and types of previously described mtDNA polymorphisms and measure the prevalence of novel variants. A main goal was to replicate the finding that a majority of POAG patients harbor novel and potentially pathogenic variants in mtDNA, in particular transversional base substitutions. This observation has been cited as evidence for mitochondrial involvement in glaucoma and could explain the systemic respiratory defects observed in cells from POAG patients, and possibly the high prevalence of POAG in African-Americans. If commonly detectable in peripheral blood, such variation could have translational utility. For example, inherited or acquired mitochondrial dysfunction in POAG may be treatable with dietary interventions.",

            "This research was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki under a protocol approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania. All subjects provided informed written consent to participate in this study.",
            "Patient recruitment and selection",
            "Subjects for deep mitochondrial sequencing were randomly selected from those recruited for the Primary Open-angle African-American Glaucoma Genetics (POAAGG) study within the clinical practices of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Clinical research coordinators screened potential subjects based on institutional review board-approved inclusion/exclusion criteria. All POAAGG subjects must self-identify as Black (African-American, African descent, African Caribbean) and be age 35 or older. Subjects who met these criteria provided informed written consent, following a physician\u2019s review of the subject\u2019s medical record. Subjects were placed into two phenotypic categories: case or control. Case subjects were defined as those diagnosed with primary/chronic open-angle glaucoma, who had no prior diagnosis or history of ocular inflammations (e.g. uveitis), high myopia (-8 diopters or greater), other forms of glaucoma (e.g., traumatic, pseudoexfoliation, narrow/closed angle and neovascular), optic-nerve neuropathy, optic-nerve drusen and vein/artery occlusion of the retina. None of the cases had normal tension glaucoma. To ensure phenotypic rigor, POAG was defined as the presence of an open angle with both criteria employed by the LALES study: \"(1) congruent, characteristic or compatible glaucomatous visual \ufb01eld (VF) abnormality and (2) evidence of characteristic or compatible glaucomatous optic disc damage in at least one eye. Case subjects were graded based on clinical ophthalmic examination and were required to have:",
            "potential secondary causes of glaucoma excluded;",
            "characteristic glaucomatous optic nerve changes in one or both eyes consisting of at least one of the following: a) excavation, neuroretinal rim thinning, notching or a nerve fiber layer defect; and b) asymmetry of the cup to disc ratio between eyes of greater than 0.2;",
            "characteristic visual field defects defined by at least one of the following on two consecutive visual fields in at least one eye and consistent with optic nerve evaluation: a) glaucoma hemi field test result of outside normal limits; and b) pattern standard deviation triggered at 5% or worse.\"",
            "Exclusion criteria for POAAGG controls were: a history of any form of glaucoma, vein/artery occlusion of the retina, high myopia, ocular inflammation, optic nerve neuropathy or a significant visual field loss associated with ocular disease (e.g. proliferative diabetic retinopathy). The following ocular comorbidities were documented for all subjects and did not prohibit enrollment as defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria: macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, pseudophakia and posterior vitreous detachment.",
            "A detailed ocular examination was performed on all subjects, and phenotypic data for the following variables were collected: intra-ocular pressure (at enrollment and maximum), central corneal thickness, cup to disc ratio and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Intra-ocular pressure was obtained by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), and where a reliable GAT was not possible, a portable tonometer was utilized. An ultrasonic pachymeter was used to obtain central corneal thickness. The estimated cup to disc ratio was determined by the clinician\u2019s observation of the optic nerve during a dilated fundus examination. RNFL was measured by ocular coherence tomography (OCT). The subject\u2019s medical record was reviewed for data on additional variables: current or previous treatment with ocular medication, current or previous ocular surgery and a family history of glaucoma. All available ocular imaging reports from OCT, Heidelberg retinal tomography, visual field and fundus photography were reviewed for each subject.",
            "787 case subjects were questioned for family history of POAG. 428 cases presented with a positive family history, and 22 of these were randomly selected for mitochondrial sequencing, along with 22 age-matched controls (+/- 5 years).",

Thermal cycling was done on a BioRad iCyler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) as follows: 94 deg 2 min; 32 cycles (94 deg 10 sec, 71 deg 30 sec, 68 deg 24.5 min with increase of 20 sec per cycle); 72 deg 5 min; hold 10 deg.

PCR products and sequencing libraries were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Ion Torrent sequencing libraries were constructed using Ion Xpress fragment library kits with enzymatic shearing and the Ion Xpress bar-code adapters 1-16 kit. A Pippin Prep instrument (Sage Science, Beverly, MA) was used for size selection during library construction. DNA concentrations were quantified and size distributions evaluated with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Emulsion PCR and enrichment were done with Xpress Template kit v2.0 and Ion OneTouch-ES instrument. A QuBit 2.0 fluorometer was used for quality control and to quantify Ion sphere particle enrichment. Ion sphere particles were sequenced using Ion 314 or 316 chips with 65 or 130 cycles of nucleotide incorporation on an Ion Torrent PGM instrument with Ion PGM 200 sequencing kits.

Additional Sanger sequencing covering >82% of the mitochondrial genome was analyzed to estimate Ion Torrent sequence accuracy and the numbers and types of false positives and false negatives, using the same PCR products used for Ion Torrent library construction. Approximately 25% of the variants inferred from Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing were re-tested by CE, Sanger sequencing to estimate error frequencies and types.

The VariantCaller was set to \u201csomatic\u201d setting, with 5% as the threshold for variant reporting. To reduce the likelihood of false positives, candidate variants with mixed base calls below a filtering threshold of 25% were excluded from further analysis. Variants not confirmed by reanalysis with v2.2 of VariantCaller, by resequencing the same library a second time on Ion Torrent or by CE, Sanger sequencing were also excluded. The Integrated Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) was used to view the alignment of individual reads. Ion Torrent and Sanger reads were assembled to the mitochondrial reference sequence NC_012920.1 (revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS)) and the complete human genome reference sequence (hg19) for analysis. Mutation nomenclature is per HGVS guidelines (www.hgvs.org) and refers to the rCRS mitochondrial reference sequence.",
            "Sequence Analysis 5.2 software (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA) was used for CE, Sanger base calling with default settings, and chromatograms were trimmed to exclude low-quality regions (QV<25) and aligned to the rCRS with Sequencher v4.9 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Ion Torrent overall sequencing accuracy on mtDNA was estimated from the number of concordant calls between Sanger and Ion Torrent sequencing. False negative variants were defined as those that were detected by Sanger sequencing, but not by Ion Torrent, and false positive variants as those reported by Ion Torrent, but subsequently invalidated by Sanger. The \"false negative variant rate\" was defined as S/(S+B), and the \"false positive variant rate\" as I/(I+B), where S = variants detected by Sanger, but not Ion Torrent (false negatives), and B = variants detected by both methods (true positives) and I = variants detected by Ion Torrent, but not Sanger (false positives). S, B and I were calculated individually for transitions ((purine <-> purine: A<->G) or (pyrimidine <-> pyrimidine: C<->T)), transversions (purine <-> pyrimidine: A<->C, A<->T, G<->C, G<->T) and insertions plus deletions. Consensus sequences derived from combining the Ion Torrent and CE, Sanger results have been deposited in GenBank, accession numbers KF055290- KF055333. The MITOMAP and MITOMASTER resources (http://www.mitomap.org), Build 15 of the PhyloTree database (www.phylotree.org) and the mtDB database were used to classify variants as novel, disease- and/or haplogroup-associated polymorphisms and for phylogenetic analysis. PolyPhen-2 was used to predict the pathogenicity of nonsynonymous variants. Statistical significance using Fisher\u2019s exact test and confidence intervals on proportions, using the modified Wald method, were computed using an online calculator (http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs) and means compared by t-test in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).",

Additional Sanger sequencing, primarily targeting the more variable D-loop, was done to further estimate the location, type and frequency of false positives and false negatives in the Ion Torrent data. For purposes of error estimation, 82% of the mitochondrial genome was resequenced with one or more Sanger reads, and 59,038 base pairs were screened for variants and compared to Ion Torrent results.",
            "Most Ion Torrent errors were related to sequence context and confined to only 7 loci in mtDNA. Typically these were runs of the same base, and false negative variants, mostly insertions or deletions, were more common than false positive variants. 43 false negative errors and 6 false positive errors were found. Accordingly, Ion Torrent sequencing accuracy was estimated to be >99.9%. More than 86% of the Ion Torrent errors were false negatives involving failure to call small insertions and deletions. The \"false negative variant rate\" (see Methods for definition) for the Ion Torrent sequencing on mtDNA was estimated to be 0.2% for transitions, and 0% for transversions. The \"false positive variant rate\" was estimated to be 1.0% for transitions and 11.8% for transversions.",
            "Sequence variation in POAG cases and controls",
            "Complete coverage of the single long PCR amplicon by Ion Torrent sequencing was obtained for all 44 samples. The amplicon covered 99.5% of the mitochondrial genome and was sequenced to a mean coverage depth of >1,000x. A total of 2,166 instances of variation and 474 different variants (Table S1 ) from the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) were identified and classified using MITOMAP, a compendium of polymorphisms and mutations in human mitochondrial DNA (http://www.mitomap.org/MITOMAP) (Figure 1 ). Nearly all instances of variation, 99.8%, corresponded to polymorphisms that have been reported by others and are described in MITOMAP (Table 2 ).",
            "Of the 474 different variants, nearly identical numbers were observed to be unique to cases (152) and to controls (153), and a minority of variants (169) were observed in both cases and controls (Figure 1 ). 71% of the 474 different variants were observed only once in 44 samples, i.e., most mtDNA variants were rare in the population as a whole. The number of different \"rare\" variants, defined here as those that were observed only once, was not greater in POAG cases than controls (Figure 2 ). A few variants were observed very frequently, 17 or more times, in both cases and controls. This was expected, and these represent instances in which the rCRS itself contains a rare variant. Transitional base substitutions greatly outnumbered transversions, as expected for known human mtDNA variants. The ratio of transitions to transversions among the previously reported variants was 27:1 for POAG cases and 30:1 for controls (Table 2 ).",
            "Only four \"novel\" variants, defined as those not found in MITOMAP, were detected in 44 mtDNAs; three of these were found in POAG cases and one in a control (Tables 2 ,  3 ). Accordingly, the proportion of African-Americans with novel mtDNA variants was 9.1% (95% confidence interval: 3% to 22%), with novel variants observed in 13.6% of POAG cases (95% confidence interval: 4% to 34%), and 4.5% of controls (95% confidence interval: <0.01% to 24%). The difference in number of POAG cases (1) with novel variants from controls (3) with novel variants is not statistically significant. All three novel variants in POAG cases were transitions (Table 3 ). The first, m.8274C>T, occurs in a non-coding region and has been observed in other primates (tarsier and bush baby, source: UCSC human genome browser conservation track) and is therefore unlikely to be pathogenic. The second, m.11813C>T, causes a Leu>Phe amino acid replacement at an imperfectly conserved residue in the ND4 gene, and was predicted to be \"benign\" by PolyPhen-2. The third, m.12266A>G, is located within the 5'-acceptor end of the MT-TL2 tRNA leucine gene. This A>G transition has been observed in another primate and other organisms according to the Mamit-tRNA database (http://mamit-tRNA.u-strasbg.fr), so is also unlikely to be pathogenic.",
            "For the population as a whole (n = 44) the proportion with novel transversions was 2.3% (95% confidence interval: <0.01% to 13%). No POAG cases were found to harbor a novel transversion (purine <-> pyrimidine substitution) in mtDNA (95% confidence interval: 0% to 18%), but one instance of a novel transversion, m.10694A>T, was observed in a control (95% confidence interval: <0.01% to 24%) (Table 3 ). This substitution, within the coding region of the ND4L gene, is synonymous and presumably benign. The difference between cases and controls with novel transversions was not significant (p = 1.00, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed). No novel insertions or deletions were found (Table 2 ). Instances of previously reported insertions and deletions were detected, but did not differ significantly between cases and controls (p = 0.75, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed). Six apparently heteroplasmic variants were identified (m.310T>C, m.1999A>G, m.13581T>C, m.16150C>T, m.16390G>A, m.16399A>G), four in cases and two in controls. These were identified on the basis of mixed Ion Torrent reads, with variant frequencies ranging from 25% to 60%, and the heteroplasmy was confirmed by CE, Sanger sequencing (Figure 3 ). The difference between POAG cases having heteroplasmic variants vs. controls was not statistically significant, and these variants have all been reported previously.",
            "Polymorphisms were classified as \"disease-associated\" if annotated as such by MITOMAP and at least one publication has proposed a linkage to disease. A total of 171 instances of disease-associated variants of 31 different types were detected, 84 in POAG cases and 87 in controls, and 0% were transversions (Table 4 ). On average, 3.8 instances of disease-associated variation were found per POAG case, vs. 4.0 per control. Variant m.16189T>C, linked to multiple diseases, was observed twice as often in controls as in cases; however this difference is not statistically significant. The differences in frequency between cases and controls for the 30 other disease-associated nucleotide changes also did not differ significantly (Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed).",

Twice as many cases (8) as controls (4) were found in haplogroup L2, but this difference is not significant (p = 0.31, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed).

            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "Novel variants, transitions and transversions in POAG mtDNA",
            "A 2006 study reported 34 different novel mtDNA variants in 27 POAG cases, 8 of which are now present in MITOMAP, leaving 26 of these variants as currently novel. Using the same criterion, absence from MITOMAP, to define novelty, the present study found only three novel variants (Table 3 ) in 22 African-American POAG cases, a proportion that is lower by seven-fold than the 2006 study and did not differ significantly from controls. The 2006 study reported novel nonsynonymous variants classified as \"pathogenic\" in 52% (14 of 27) POAG cases, whereas this study identified novel nonsynonymous variants in less than 5% (1 of 22) POAG cases. This difference is highly significant (p<.0004, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed); furthermore, the sole novel nonsynonymous variant detected in an African-American POAG case (Table 3 ) was not predicted to be pathogenic. Accordingly, this evidence does not support the proposition that novel nonsynonymous or pathogenic variants are found commonly in mtDNA from POAG blood.",
            "Vertebrate mitochondrial genomes are characterized by rapid molecular evolution relative to nuclear genes and an extreme bias favoring transitional base substitutions relative to transversional substitutions. This bias varies little among the mitochondria of humans and great apes. It is therefore unexpected that the 2006 study identified novel transversions in mtDNA of 17 of 27 (63%) of Saudi POAG cases, with a high ratio of transversions to transitions. The present study\u2019s finding that 0 of 22 African-American POAG cases harbored a novel mitochondrial transversion is significantly lower (p<0.0001, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed) and does not support the theory that novel mtDNA transversions are characteristic of POAG, or that alternative DNA damage and repair mechanisms are involved in the generation of mtDNA mutations in POAG patients.",
            "Random sequencing errors are more likely to generate candidate mtDNA variants that appear to be: 1) novel (because the number of reported polymorphisms is small relative to the number of possible substitutions in mtDNA), 2) nonsynonymous (because most possible mtDNA substitutions correspond to open reading frames and alter coding) or 3) transversions (because a 2:1 ratio of transversions to transitions is expected from chance). No novel nonsynonymous transversions were detected in 44 samples. The overall concordance between Sanger and Ion Torrent sequencing was >99.9%, so is unlikely that the number of novel transversions in mtDNA of POAG cases was underestimated substantially. However, Sanger sequencing confirmed that both false negative and false positive errors were present in the Ion Torrent data. The large majority of errors were false negatives on true small insertions or deletions located at homopolymer tracts, e.g., a run of 7 C nucleotides at rCRS positions 303-309. The false negative variant rate was 0% for transversions, vs. 0.2% for transitions and the false positive variant rate was 11.8% for transversions vs. 1.0% for transitions. Accordingly, the number of transversions was more likely to be overestimated than underestimated. Another possible source of error in PCR-based mtDNA sequencing is off-target amplification of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial pseudogenes. This possibility was minimized by using long (>30 base pair) PCR primers and a single very large (16,487 base pair) amplicon for PCR enrichment. No evidence was found for significant amplification of nuclear DNA, based on absence of secondary bands on DNA gels and results from aligning Ion Torrent reads to the complete human genome reference sequence, hg19 (data not shown).",
            "A limitation of this study was that an 82 base pair region of the D-loop, corresponding to rCRS positions 1-9 and 16,497-16,569, was outside the single PCR amplicon, i.e., 0.5% of each genome was not amplified, and any variants in this region were not detected. Candidate variants called with frequencies <25% were excluded from the analysis to reduce the likelihood of false positives, so if true low-level heteroplasmic variants were present, these are likely to have been missed as well. We did not attempt to characterize the Ion Torrent PGM\u2019s sensitivity to low-level mitochondrial heteroplasmy; however, our results suggest it is likely to be position-specific and dependent on factors such as read depth, sequence context and type of genetic alteration. Consistent with a recent study, we found the Ion Torrent\u2019s error rate on insertions and deletions was much higher than for substitutions. The practice of equating variant \"novelty\" with non-registration in MITOMAP has been criticized on the basis that other approaches, such as Google searching, may be more sensitive to identifying previously observed variants. Accordingly, using a more stringent criterion to define \"novelty\" may result in estimates for the proportion of POAG patients and controls harboring a novel variant that are even lower than the 9.1% reported here.",
            "Implications for POAG pathogenesis in African-Americans",
            "The functional significance, if any, of the individual novel, previously reported and disease-associated variants for POAG for African-Americans was outside the scope of this study, but deserves further investigation. This study lacked the statistical power needed to detect effects of individual sequence variants; the large majority of variants were rare, only observed once in cases or controls. The 31 disease-associated variants (Table 4 ) are a subset of polymorphisms for which a linkage to a disease has been proposed in one or more publications. However, distinguishing mildly pathogenic mitochondrial mutations from benign variants is challenging, with interpretation subject to controversy. A particular mtDNA variant may be both deleterious and beneficial depending on its haplogroup and environmental context. For example, a European haplogroup J background has been shown to increase the penetrance of primary LHON mutations and to sensitize cells to environmental insults, such as exposure to hexane.",
            "The great diversity in mtDNA ancestral haplogroups present in African-Americans adds further complexity to interpreting sequence variation. Although this study only examined 44 people, the deepest roots of human ancestry are represented (Figure 4 ). At least 20% of the study population was assigned to each of the African haplogroups L1, L2 and L3. These three are estimated to have diverged approximately 142,300 +/-38,200 years ago. Accordingly, future studies of mitochondrial variation in African-Americans and its possible relationship to POAG might be stratified to ensure that the major haplogroups have balanced representation in cases and controls, so as not to confound ancient and recent variation.",
            "A larger total number of variants was observed in cases (1,146) than in controls (1,020) (Table 2 ). This likely reflects differences in the ancestral composition of the two groups, in conjuction with the use of the rCRS, a European haplogroup H mtDNA, as the reference sequence. If, for example, the African-American POAG patients had been compared to a hypothetical control group with exclusively European maternal ancestry, one would expect to observe fewer variants in that control group, on account of its recent common ancestry with the rCRS. The control group for this study was indeed found to contain fewer L1 and L2 mtDNAs, which are distantly related to the rCRS (Figure 4 ). So the direction of systematic bias from imperfectly balanced ancestry plus use of the European rCRS to identify \"variants\" was to favor variant identification in the POAG group over controls. Such a bias might be controlled for in future studies by scoring variation relative to a derived common ancestral sequence, such as the Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence, which incoporates recent data from Neanderthal mtDNAs.",

            "Conclusions",
            "African-American POAG cases closely resembled controls with respect to frequency and types of sequence variation in mtDNA, with very similar numbers of novel variants, heteroplasmic variants, transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions and disease-associated polymorphisms. This work did not directly address the issue of whether mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to POAG pathogenesis. However it does suggest that if mitochondrial functional defects are found in African-American POAG patients, as in other populations, these defects are unlikely to be explained or diagnosed by an unusual mutational spectrum in mtDNA that is detectable in peripheral blood. Future studies will require larger cohorts and could consider ancestral haplogroups, somatic mtDNA variation within the eye, variation in nuclear mitochondrial genes and environmental exposures that may impair mitochondrial function.",

            "ABSTRACT",
            "The Neolithic burial of Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo (CS) represents a unique archaeological finding for the prehistory of Southern Italy. The unusual placement of the inhumation at a rather high altitude and\u00a0far from inhabited areas, the lack of funerary equipment and the\u00a0prone deposition of the body\u00a0find limited similarities\u00a0in coeval Italian sites. These elements have prompted wider questions on mortuary customs during the prehistory of Southern Italy. This atypical case requires an interdisciplinary approach aimed to build an integrated bioarchaeological profile of the individual. The paleopathological investigation of the skeletal remains revealed the presence of numerous markers that could be associated with craft activities, suggesting possible interpretations of the individual\u2019s lifestyle. CT analyses, carried out on the maxillary bones, showed the presence of a peculiar type of dental wear, but also a good density of the bone matrix. Biomolecular and micromorphological analyses of dental calculus highlight the presence of a rich Neolithic-like oral microbiome, the composition of which is consistent with the presence pathologies. Finally, paleogenomic data obtained from the individual were compared with ancient and modern Mediterranean populations, including unpublished high-resolution genome-wide data for 20 modern inhabitants of the nearby village of San Lorenzo Bellizzi, which provided interesting insights into the biodemographic landscape of the Neolithic in Southern Italy.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "At the end of the sixth millennium BCE, Neolithic lifeways are well established in Southern Italy (SI). Pottery appears in the archaeological record of the Early and Middle Neolithic phases in Apulia, Basilicata and Calabria; the hunting-gathering economic system starts to be replaced by the spread of farming activities, even though a complete shift to an agriculture-based subsistence strategy does not occur before the Bronze Age. Radical changes can be seen in the settlement strategies during the Early and Middle Neolithic phases in SI, mostly based on the occupation of coastal and sub-coastal areas, such as Favella di Corigliano (CS), representing one of the most ancient farming villages in Italy, and one of the first pottery-industry in Central-Western Europe. By contrast, evidence of human presence in the inner territories of SI are sporadic until the advanced phases of the Neolithic. In such context, the archaeological site of Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo represents a unicum for the human exploitation of SI during the Neolithic.",
            "Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo is an extended limestone massif located on the Calabrian side of the Pollino National Park (Fig.\u00a01a), in the municipality of San Lorenzo Bellizzi (Cosenza). The massif is extremely rich in cavities, with at least 21 vertical and horizontal caves surveyed in the area. Among them, Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo preserves the most ancient evidence of human activity in Northern Calabria. The location of the cavity (Fig.\u00a01b) at a rather high altitude (>\u20091000\u00a0m asl) and not easily visible from the valley, has allowed it to survive post-depositional disturbances. The stratigraphic reconstruction of the archaeological deposit testifies a consistent use of the small cavity (less than 20\u00a0m in length) throughout the Neolithic period, as suggested by the presence of trichrome, bichrome and impressed ware, while scarce and sporadic evidence of a more recent frequentation has been attested.",
            "The archaeological excavations conducted since 2017 revealed the presence of a single burial located a few meters from the entrance of the cavity (Fig.\u00a01c). The skeletal remains (Fig.\u00a01d) were found inside an ovular pit directly carved in the ground: the buried individual (SLB henceforth) was found prone, E\u2013W oriented, face turned to the earth and in an extremely contracted position; medium-sized stones covered the skull and the right side of the body, with smaller stones lying above the pelvis, trunk, and limbs. Despite a consistent anthropogenic presence in the cave, marked by evidence of pottery fragments associated with the Diana and Serra d\u2019Alto facies, the cave did not yield any further signs of funerary activity. The lack of funerary equipment, along with the use of a simple pit inside a cave, led to a Neolithic contextualization of the burial. This was later confirmed by radiocarbon analysis, which placed SLB within the Middle Neolithic (6092\u2009\u00b1\u200945 BP; 5207\u20135048\u00a0cal BCE, 19,1%/5084\u20134899\u00a0cal BCE, 74,8%/4864\u20134853\u00a0cal BCE, 1,5%). However, the individual from Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo represents an interesting exception in the funerary landscape of the Italian Neolithic: single inhumations, during the earliest and the more advanced phases of Neolithic in SI, are generally found within the domestic area, with the body lying on one side, mostly buried in pits directly carved in the ground or inside silos and niches. Evidence of mortuary depositions far from inhabited areas can be found throughout the Neolithic in proper Apulian funerary contexts, such as necropolis and burial cavities. However, considering the location of the cave and the problems that arise in accessing it, due to the presence of steep vertical crags, this burial constitutes a unique archaeological marker of human Neolithic presence in the mountains of SI. Moreover, the unusual placement of the burial inside the cave, located only a few meters from the entrance and partially exposed to natural light, raises questions on the funerary habits of Neolithic humans in SI, and more specifically on the life history of the individual. We wondered if the genetic ancestry, the state of health, occupation or social identity could somehow be connected to the unconventional burial. A well-established methodological approach combining biomolecular archaeology, physical anthropology and archaeothanatology was able to provide answers to some of these questions, and helped us reconstruct an almost complete bioarchaeological profile of the individual. Anthropological and paleopathological investigations of the remains have been supplemented with computerized tomography scanning of the mandible and the maxilla (Fig.\u00a01e). The presence of dental calculus has allowed the characterization of the microdebris trapped in the mineral matrix, as well as the recovery of interesting information on the composition of the oral microbiome and the potential state of disease thanks to the combination of metagenomics and paleoproteomics analyses. Finally, a complete mitochondrial genome and the first whole genome data from prehistoric Calabria have been produced through shotgun sequencing. In fact, while ancient DNA approaches have been applied to investigate the Neolithic transition in Northern, Central, and insular Italy, few ancient DNA data have been produced yet for prehistoric SI and very little is known about the paleogenomic landscape of Calabria. Thus, genomic data obtained here were investigated in the context of modern and ancient variability of Mediterranean populations. To improve our understanding of population dynamics, samples of 20 modern autochthonous individuals from the village of San Lorenzo Bellizzi were collected and genotyped for\u2009~\u2009720,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).",
            "RESULTS",
            "Results",
            "Anthropological investigation",
            "The skeletal remains of the individual were found in a very contracted position, with the torso prone, the face resting on the bottom of the pit, with elbows and knees bent; both forearms were placed under the body, with the lower limbs reassembled on the right side and arranged with the legs hyper-flexed on the thighs. The mandible and the maxilla were found in full occlusion. The primary character of the deposition has been defined by the correct anatomical arrangement of the skeletal elements and by the persistence of labile connections; the absence of disjunction of the vertebral spaces, the maintenance of the volume of the rib cage, and the anatomical connection of the bones of the hands and feet suggest that the decomposition occurred in a filled pit. The individual, an adult male \u00b1\u200930\u00a0years old, about 164\u00a0cm\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0cm tall, showed extreme wear patterns on the teeth (Fig.\u00a02a), involving the complete loss of crown height in the lower incisors. Dental enamel is almost absent from the occlusal surface, leaving a nearly continuous dentinal surface surrounded by a partial rim of enamel, and causing a remarkable reduction in tooth size.",
            "Numerous streaks were visible by stereomicroscopy in all directions on the occlusal surfaces of lower incisors and canines (Fig.\u00a02b), as well as crown fractures and signs of chipping on the anterior mandibular and maxillary teeth. A more pronounced oblique wear on the lingual surface of the maxillary teeth and on the buccal surface of the mandibular teeth (friction) is present, along with signs of wear on the tooth surface (abrasion), particularly evident on the mandibular and maxillary first molars; chipping and fractures of the crowns on the posterior teeth (molars) are also visible. Diffuse recession of the alveolar bone and exposure of the dental roots are present as well as an intra-vitam loss of the second maxillary right premolar, probably following an abscess within the alveolar bone. Small amount of calculus on the teeth surfaces were also identified.",
            "CT-investigation of the jaws (Fig.\u00a02c) reported a good density of the bone matrix, consistent with the age of the individual; a generalized bone absorption is visible at the alveolar level, indicating the presence of a periodontal disease that could have led to the loss of the maxillary second premolar. The relationships between the two jaw bones show a forward sliding of the lower jaw (class III) in head-to-head closure of the incisors. It allows us to estimate an original position of the lower jaw (in class I) that changed over time due to the lack of occlusal mandibular and maxillary stability.",
            "Regarding the postcranial skeleton, abnormal bone formation or destruction patterns were observed at the level of the joints. Moderate marginal osteophytes have been detected on the right and left upper extremity (proximal epiphysis of the right ulna and distal epiphysis of the right and left radius) and on the pelvic girdle (left acetabulum). Depressed surfaces with smooth edges were observed on the right distal surface of humeral\u00a0trochlea (10\u00a0mm long), on posterior surface of the left and right tarsal navicular bones (about 3\u00a0mm long) and on the first proximal phalanx of the right toe (concal proximal facet, 10\u00a0mm long). Such patterns are typical of osteochondritis dissecans, a pathological condition of the subchondral bone supporting cartilage of synovial joints, consisting in the partial or complete detachment of articular cartilage from subchondral bone. Patterns of abnormal bone formation and destruction were identified at the shafts. Non-specific periostitis on the midshafts of tibiae and fibulae is visible, and moderate abnormal bone formations in the form of enthesopathies are present, affecting the inferior surface of both clavicles at the attachment of the ligament of the conoid process and the sites of flexor tendons on palmar surface of proximal hand phalanges. Severe oval grooves are evident along the inferior surface of the right clavicle at the attachment of the costoclavicular ligament (rhomboid fossa); on the left clavicle the lesion appears as moderate depression (enthesopathies), while on the upper humeral shaft, moderate depression at the attachment of the pectoralis major muscle is present. Abnormal bone shapes have also been detected, involving a probable greenstick fracture of the right clavicle and backward inclination of the tibial plateau.",
            "Finally, a lateral extension of the articular surface of the right glenoid cavity occurs on the insertion of inferior glenoid labrum; no ossification of ligaments and tendon attachment are present as well as no osteophytes, indicating a possible instability or flexibility of the shoulder joint. Squatting facets are present on the anterior surface of the trochlea of talus and on the anterior margin of the lower end of the tibial extension, indicating a habitual contact between the two anatomical elements.",
            "Dental calculus analysis",
            "The microdebris analysis of dental calculus revealed the presence of a variety of poorly diagnostic microremains (Supplementary Information). Most of these were of plant origin and consisted of starch granules (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02A), plant tissues (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02B), a trichome (plant hair, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02C), but in most cases they could not be assigned even to Family level. Two of the plant remains retrieved were consistent with fibers (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02D,E), but they were of low diagnostic nature, too. Dark brown particles (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02G) might be evidence of micro-charcoal, but they also lacked secure distinctive features, therefore they were described as \u2018burnt debris\u2019\u2014to acknowledge their uncertain nature. There was also mineral grit (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02F), but optical microscopy alone does not allow the identification of such remains, and it will be subject of future analysis. Despite the poor diagnostic nature of the remains, they suggest the consumption of starchy food and leafy crops. The presence of remains such as fibers and mineral grit, that may have contributed to the dental wear of the individual, could also be associated with occupational activity. However, the very limited quantity of potential textile fibers and their insecure identification make it difficult to provide a clear interpretation. In fact, fibers can also be found in calculus sample where no dental wear patterns are reported, and thus extreme caution must be taken in the interpretation of these remains.",
            "Paleogenomic analysis was performed on dental calculus to define the ancient oral microbial community of SLB. Single-stranded genomic libraries were built from ancient DNA extracts of dental calculus and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X platform, producing 7,695,982 paired-end reads. We applied HOPS, a tool specifically conceived for the taxonomic characterization of short-read shotgun metagenomic data. Several host-associated bacteria have been identified in the dental calculus, among which different members of the genera Treponema, Prevotella, Streptococcus and Methanobrevibacter are present (a list with the 50 most abundant microbial species identified in the dental calculus is reported in Supplementary Table S1). As expected for dental calculi samples, members of bacterial genera associated with both human host and environment (e.g., Actinomyces spp., Streptomyces sp. and Pseudomonas spp.) were also detected. The ancient origin was validated by evaluating the number of reads for each specific taxon, the post mortem degradation score (PMDS), the negative difference proportion score (\u2212\u0394 %) and the presence of pattern of deamination C-T. Taxa with more than 300 assigned reads, more than 50 reads with PMDS\u2009>\u20091,\u2009\u2212\u2009\u0394 %\u2009>\u20090.9 and showing patterns of C-T transition at 5\u2032 were considered to be of ancient origin (Supplementary Table S1) A large number of reads assigned to previously identified human oral taxa sustained deamination and substitution profiles that are consistent with ancient DNA (e.g., Treponema denticola, Actinomyces dentalis, Streptococcus gordonii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Porphyromonas gengivalis, Prevotella intermedia). Of the species retrieved, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis constitute the most pathogenic aggregate of oral bacteria, namely the \u201cred complex\u201d, recognized to be strongly associated with periodontal disease. The occurrence of these three species in terms of number of reads (Table S1) is in line with the expected abundance, as highlighted in other studies. The oral metagenomes detected from dental calculus were compared in Principal Coordinates Analysis (Fig.\u00a03) with available ancient oral microbiomes data of Neanderthal (n\u2009=\u200914, green), pre-agricultural (n\u2009=\u200951, orange), Neolithic (n\u2009=\u200916, yellow), pre-antibiotics (n\u2009=\u200915, blue) and modern (n\u2009=\u200918, light blue) origin. Notably, 16 of these metagenomes belong to ancient Italian individuals geographically and temporally matching with our sample. The oral microbiome of SLB (red dot) lies in proximity to samples of Neolithic/pre-agricultural origin, indicating a major sharing of taxa with microbiomes of this period as expected by the age of the sample. To further investigate the metagenomic component of the individual, ancient DNA sequences generated from tooth dentin of SLB (see section \u201cAncient human DNA\u201d) were also screened for the most common bacterial pathogens, as suggested by the literature. According to our findings, no DNA traces of potential pathogens were found (Supplementary Table S2). It must be noted however that pathogen DNA may not have been preserved through time on the dentin due to the conformation and thickness of the different bacterial cell walls or because some pathogens do not enter the bloodstream and are most likely undetectable. Moreover, our analysis is completely blinded to viruses, especially RNA viruses, whose genetic material is hardly preserved in ancient samples, and few attempts to sequence ancient transcriptomes have been published so far.",
            "Paleoproteomics of a small dental calculus sample yielded 1309 unique protein hits (Supplementary Dataset). Among these, 27 belong to the host (Supplementary Table S3) and most (20) are associated with the innate immune system (Supplementary Fig. S3). Others are related to hemostasis, the metabolism of proteins and the digestion of dietary carbonate (amylases). Most of the identified proteins were of bacterial origin (1271). The analysis of the taxonomic composition of the ancient microbiome is complicated by the fact that the same peptide sequence may be found in several taxa, leading to multiple hits. Nonetheless, considering the taxa that yielded the highest number of protein hits, Arachnia spp., Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Olsenella spp. and Ottowia spp. are the most represented. All these taxa are components of the healthy core oral microbiome (eHOMD https://www.homd.org, accessed 11/01/2023). The presence of Treponema spp. and Tannerella spp., present among the \u201cred complex\u201d bacteria, is confirmed also from the proteome. Other bacteria of potential interest include Aggregatibacter spp., Cardiobacterium spp. and Eikenella corrodens, regular components of a healthy microbiome, but which can, in rare cases, be the cause of infective endocarditis.",
            "Ancient human DNA",
            "Ancient DNA was extracted from one molar of SLB to test for endogenous DNA persistence and provide a genetic profile of the individual. The extracts were converted into single-stranded genomic libraries and sequenced for a total of 531 million reads on Illumina HiSeq-X Ten Platform. The endogenous DNA retrieved reported a genome-wide coverage of 0.24X, with\u2009>\u2009290,000 SNPs overlapping the 1240\u00a0K\u2014Human Origins SNP Array v54.1 (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data). Deamination patterns among the sequences were consistent with the age of the sample (Supplementary Fig. S4), and the presence of modern contamination was excluded both at the X-chromosome (6%) and mitochondrial level (2%) (Supplementary Table S4). A 39-fold complete mitochondrial genome was reconstructed from the individual, reporting 33 unique variants when compared to the rCRS. The mitochondrial haplogroup has been assigned with 99% accuracy to K1a\u2009+\u2009195 haplogroup. The Y-chromosome haplogroup was identified as a G2a2a1 by comparing high quality reads of SLB to an informative list of Y-chromosome SNPs (https://isogg.org/tree/). Both the X/autosomes coverage ratio and Y/sex chromosomes coverage ratio suggest the individual to be male, confirming the outcome of the anthropological investigation. A phylogenetic tree (Fig.\u00a04a) was reconstructed to investigate the clustering of the individual in the landscape of prehistoric K-related mitochondrial lineages, and SLB clusters in proximity with other K1a\u2009+\u2009195, in particular with one individual from the Neolithic settlement of Makotrasy (I14173, Baalberge culture, Czech Republic) dated 4300\u20133500 BCE. Interestingly, the MJN performed for mitochondrial variability shows SLB being few nodes far from another K1-related prehistoric individual from Italy, the Iceman, whose rare mitochondrial haplogroup has been identified only within the Alps area (Supplementary Fig. S5).",
            "Under a diachronic and geographical population perspective, we compared our sample with ancient and modern populations using principal component analysis. PCA projection on a dataset of ancient samples shows how SLB falls into the variability of the Italian and Mediterranean Neolithic, near Peloponnesian and Anatolian Neolithic individuals (Fig.\u00a04b).",
            "The SLB individual was then projected on a dataset of 737 modern Italians (Fig.\u00a04d), representative of the genetic variability of Italy (see \u201cMaterial and methods\u201d section), merged with unpublished genomic data obtained from 20 modern inhabitants of the nearby municipality of San Lorenzo Bellizzi. The geographic clustering of the samples reveals a clear latitudinal gradient along the peninsula, where the Sardinian cluster is clearly separated from the rest. The modern inhabitants of San Lorenzo Bellizzi cluster together, in close proximity to the Southern Italian control group, but do not overlap with it; instead, they appear separate from the rest of the modern samples, indicating a possible isolation and a subsequent genetic drift effect. Despite being geographically close, the Neolithic individual SLB does not fall within the variability of modern groups, within that of the modern inhabitants of San Lorenzo Bellizzi, nor within the genetic variability of the South.",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo is located at a substantial altitude, on a vertical crag that is extremely difficult to reach. Despite the many cavities that have been surveyed in the area of the rock massif, this is the only one where the presence of Neolithic funerary activities has been identified thus far. The typological characteristics of the burial found inside the cave designate it as a remarkable finding for the prehistory of Southern Italy. Similar types of deposition, with a single individual buried in a prone and huddled position, with the face turned towards the ground, can be found in Palata di Canosa, Pulo di Molfetta and Titolo di Bari-Palese, three Apulian sites dated to the Ancient and Middle Neolithic. It must be noted however that these burials are located in typical funerary contexts, within or in proximity of the villages. If one considers (1) the more general typological evidence of burying the deceased in a huddled position inside the pit, (2) the widespread presence of covering stones, and (3) the total absence of funerary equipment, more similarities can be found with the infant burial of Grotta di San Michele in Saracena and in the funerary area of the Neolithic village of Favella. However, the social meanings that underlie the heterodox funerary behaviour expressed in Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo are difficult to be addressed. When compared to other similar archaeological contexts in Northern Ionian Calabria, such as the nearby caves of Cassano allo Ionio, the absence of further human remains suggests that Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo had a marginal role as a burial site during the Middle Neolithic. Moreover, the extreme contraction of the body inside the pit proposes two interpretative scenarios: a critical frailty of the subject, which could have allowed the lower limbs to be easily flexed; the possible presence of ropes that kept the limbs together. The arrangement of the body with stones covering its entire extent could be associated with the practical aim of locking the body in the lying position. Furthermore, the completely unnatural position of the upper limbs and the hands could also indicate that the body has been arranged in such a position during the burial, either at a moment close to death, or in a later phase of at least 24\u201336\u00a0hours, i.e. the necessary time whereupon rigor mortis ceases. Despite the lack of anthropological elements that could be directly related to the cause of death, several skeletal features identified through macroscopic investigation allow us to make some considerations on the lifestyle of the individual. The analysis of the post-cranial skeleton provides information related to acute or repeated moderate microtrauma on the shoulders (suspected greenstick fracture, enthesopathies), upper limbs (osteophytes, osteochondritis dissecans, enthesopathies), pelvic girdle and lower limbs (osteophytes, periostitis, osteochondritis dissecans). These alterations might be related to a general biomechanical stress on bones and joints that could also generate peripheral aspecific bone inflammation in the lower limbs. In addition, bilateral squatting facets of the tibia and talus, and the backward inclination of the tibial plateau have been taken as evidence of hyper-flexion at the hip and knee joints and hyper-dorsiflexion at the ankle and subtalar joints; these joint markers are related to habitual use of the squatting position during life as well as prolonged standing and walking on hard/impervious surfaces and/or to genetic traits. Overall, stress-induced skeletal remodeling involving different bones in a moderate way, suggests that a variety of repeated physical activities could have played a role in the lifestyle of the individual. The analysis of the dental wear provides evidence for the use of the mouth for non-alimentary purposes, as a non-specific tool or \"third hand\". The extreme forms of wear patterns of the lower incisors and the presence of micro-grooves on the occlusal surfaces have been taken as evidence of extra-masticatory activities and the reduction in tooth size has been described in literature as the results of the combined effects of occlusal and interproximal wear. Dental wear patterns of masticatory type attributable to friction and abrasion have been observed in posterior teeth, even if the asymmetrical wear (more prominent on the right side) might be a diagnostic element related to activities such as the preparation of food or the processing of hard or resistant materials. Furthermore, the microdebris identified through morphological investigation confirms the utilization of the mouth for non-alimentary purposes. No diagnostic elements relating to the diet were found, but the presence of magenta minerals and fibers could be associated with the use of the mouth as a third hand during the production of craft objects. While it is difficult to link these fibers securely to a craft activity, the presence of marked dental wear on the teeth of SLB and the presence of fibers could be an indication of some fiber-based craft. Such evidence has been attested in other coeval funerary contexts in SI, such as Serra Cicora in Apulia, and associated to an employment of the mouth as a working tool.",
            "Among the dental pathologies detected, chipping and fractures of the tooth\u00a0crowns have been taken as evidence of chewing of hard particles. Finally, diffuse recession of the alveolar bone and exposure of the dental roots have been related to inflammation of soft tissues (periodontal disease, gingivitis). This paleopathological evidence is concordant with the biomolecular data obtained from dental calculus.",
            "Paleoproteomics analyses of the calculus showed the presence of a rich oral microbiome, dominated by bacterial taxa commonly found in plaque and oral cavity. The authenticity of non-human peptide sequences, which could indicate the presence of dietary proteins (e.g., Bos taurus collagen), cannot be firmly established and therefore no further interpretation is attempted. The metaproteome data are consistent with the metagenomic analyses, showing the presence of Actynomyces and Streptococcus as well as of Treponema and Tannerella spp., the latter being typical of periodontal disease. In particular, metagenomic analysis highlighted the persistence of the Gram-negative bacteria Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are part of the so-called \u201cred complex\u201d bacteria, known to be strongly associated with periodontal disease, but also to a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, diabetes mellitus, and are proposed as a risk factor for other several syndromes. Among the bacteria of potential interest detected, Aggregatibacter spp., Cardiobacterium spp., and Eikenella corrodens, which are usually part of a \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome, could be in rare cases associated with the development of infective endocarditis. The presence of dental pathologies and the detection of amylases are perfectly in line with the consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, typically Neolithic, diet. Proteomics can also detect the immune response of the host, and several human proteins were observed including numerous components of the innate immune system, e.g., neutrophil degranulation and antimicrobial peptides (Supplementary Fig. S3). This provides confirmation at the molecular level of the fact that the individual had suffered from infections during his life.",
            "Due to the poor preservation of the remains during the archaeological investigation, the individual was initially identified as a female. However, ancient DNA data and laboratory analysis of the skeletal remains led to an undoubted identification of the individual as a male, confirming the outcome of a recent anthropological investigation. PCA projection of the genetic data on the dataset of ancient samples shows how SLB falls into the variability of the Italian and Mediterranean Neolithic, near the Peloponnesian and Anatolian Neolithics. This Neolithic genetic signature finds support on the uniparental haplogroups recovered from SLB: both K1a branches of mitochondrial DNA and G2a Y-chromosome sub-lineages have been indicated as part of the Neolithic genetic component that reached the European continent 8000\u00a0years ago, with G2a sub-haplogroups being the most widely distributed uniparental lineages among Neolithic Europeans (Fig.\u00a04c). When compared to modern populations, SLB shifts in proximity of the Sardinian cluster, which has been reported to retain the greatest proportion of Neolithic ancestry among all Italian samples. On the basis of modern data, the genetic prehistory of SI has been proposed to be the result of different migratory events from those that shaped the Eastern and Central Europe ancestrality, with Mediterranean genetic links between Aegean populations and SI that have been traced back to Neolithic period. The genetic contributions that linked SI with the Greek islands and Anatolia have suggested the possibility that the Mediterranean could have served as a complementary crossroad for migratory events that occurred during the Neolithic, even though such possibility cannot be fully explored with a single individual from Calabria. Nevertheless, the paleogenomic landscape of prehistoric SI is far from being understood, and new data are needed to better understand the legacy of ancient migrations in this region. The paleogenomic results presented in this work are certainly affected by the low number of SNPs used, but they represent another important step for archeomolecular studies in the Southern regions of the Italian peninsula.",
            "The results of such an interdisciplinary study allowed us to reconstruct an almost complete bioarchaeological profile of the individual. Whether the funerary anomaly expressed in Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo could be related to necrophobic or ritual practices, such theories cannot be clarified through the outcome of this interdisciplinary research. However, some of the evidence we gathered suggests interesting possibilities. The absence of traces of trauma on skeletal remains and the presence of bacteria potentially related to inflammatory diseases, combined with the detection of human proteins of the innate immune system, could suggest the persistence of a non-specific inflammatory state with potentially fatal consequences. The possibility that the individual may have died away from his community would explain the unorthodox choice of burying the person in a site where no specific mortuary functions have been attested. Despite the lack of a clear funerary equipment, the burial itself could be defined as the expression of carefully planned social behaviour, especially considering the difficulties that arise in accessing the cavity. The contribution of geochemical methodologies such as stable isotopes analysis, not applied in this study, could be beneficial to better understand the provenance of the individual. Furthermore, the authors hope that in the near future new molecular data may be generated from Calabria, whose rich prehistory deserves to be explored through integrated approaches.",

            "The examination of the position of the bones was carried out in situ before the detachment of the skeleton from the ground following the methodological indications of Crubezy et al., 1990 and Duday, 2006. A preliminary anthropological investigation was focused on biological parameters assessment such as age-at-death, sex and stature; anthropological data, were acquired through macroscopic morphological observation and metric survey of the bones, according to the main methods reported in the literature.",
            "Paleopathological analysis of the skeleton was applied to identify and describe macroscopic abnormalities on bones and joints, both in the axial and appendicular skeleton (Supplementary Fig. S1). Paleopathological analysis was conducted by direct inspection, and medical computed tomography (acquisition parameters: 1.25 section thickness, reconstruction interval 0.6\u00a0mm, 120\u00a0kV and 100\u00a0mA) carried out at UO of Radiology at the Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital in Forl\u00ec. Visual assessments include identification of pathological lesions and their distribution within the affected bones and joints, and descriptive summary of the type of the abnormal features. Descriptive analysis may provide important datasets for more in-depth paleopathological research.",
            "Microdebris analysis",
            "Microdebris analysis was performed on dental calculus retrieved from the first right lower incisor, in which the presence of wear on the occlusal surface could indicate a use of the mouth as a \"third hand\". The protocol was based on previous studies. Following the extraction of the calculus and a decontamination step to eliminate elements deriving from the burial soil, the sample was decalcified in a weak solution of hydrochloric acid (0.6\u00a0M HCl). This step dissolves the inorganic matrix and extracts all the microdebris that have been incorporated within the calculus throughout the life of the individual. The observation of the microdebris was carried out using a polarizing optical microscope with transmitted light. The slides were scanned at magnification of 160x, 400x, 1000\u2009\u00d7\u2009using a Leica ICC50 W optical microscope. The microdebris (Supplementary Fig. S2) were divided into morphotypes based on the morphology and a name, a description and hypothesis on the origin and method of incorporation assigned to each. Any suggested identification is based upon their anatomical characteristics and comparison with modern reference material and key reference texts.",
            "Protein analysis method",
            "Sample preparation for paleoproteomics was carried out at the dedicated ancient protein laboratory (\u201cArchaeobiomics\u201d) at the University of Turin, following international guidelines for minimizing contamination and ensuring the authenticity of the sequences. In brief, the sample (PALTO 247) was weighed (7.6\u00a0mg), washed in 200 \u03bcL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (EDTA, 0.5\u00a0M, pH\u2009=\u20098) for ten minutes, then demineralized in 500 \u03bcL 0.5\u00a0M EDT with gentle agitation (450 RPM) for eight days. The demineralized sample was processed following the SP3 protocol for low-protein samples. Following the reduction of disulphide bonds with dithiothreitol (1\u00a0M aqueous solution) at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min and alkylation with iodoacetamide (0.5\u00a0M aqueous solution) at room temperature for 45\u00a0min, 30 \u03bcL of Sera-Mag SpeedBeads (1:1 mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic) were added to each of the extracts. To induce binding, 100% EtOH (HPLC-grade) was added to a final EtOH concentration of 50% and incubated at 24\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min at\u2009~\u20091000\u00a0rpm. The tubes were then placed on a magnetic rack for separation, the supernatant removed and discarded. The proteins bound to the beads were cleaned with 80% EtOH (3X), exchanged to buffer (50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5\u20138) and the mixture sonicated for 30\u00a0s. After this step, trypsin was added (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg, Promega, proteomics grade) for overnight digestion at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and light shaking was applied (~\u20091000\u00a0rpm). Afterwards, the extracts were centrifuged for 1\u00a0min, placed on a magnetic rack, the supernatants containing the digested peptides were transferred to separate tubes, acidified with 10% TFA (to a final TFA concentration of 0.1%) and the samples purified using C18 solid-phase extraction tips (Pierce, Thermo-Fisher). Eluted peptides were evaporated to dryness.",
            "Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) analyses were performed at The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. The dental calculus sample (PALTO 247) was preceded by one lab control (ancient mollusk shell A) and two wash blanks and followed by one wash blank and one laboratory control (ancient mollusk shell control B). Dried peptide eluates were resuspended in 30 \u03bcL 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in water and transferred to a SpeedVac\u2122 Concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Denmark) vacuum centrifuge at 40\u00a0\u00b0C until approximately 5 \u03bcL of the solution was left. 15 \u03bcL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 5% ACN was then added to each well. Samples were then separated on a 15\u00a0cm column (75\u00a0\u03bcm inner diameter) in-house laser pulled and packed with 1.9\u00a0\u03bcm C18 beads (Dr. Maisch, Germany) on an EASY-nLC 1200 (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) connected to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) on a 77\u00a0min gradient. Four microliters of the sample/control were injected. LC and MS parameters were run according to the dental calculus method in Scorrano et al., with the HCD collision energy at 30%, RF Lens at 40%, and MS2 inject time of 54\u00a0ms to adjust for differences between the mass spectrometers.",
            "Raw mass spectrometry data were searched against a combined database of Uniprot (Universal Protein Database, downloaded 06/12/2022) and eHOMD (expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database, downloaded 06/12/2022) protein sequences using the PEAKS Studio XPro software. Outputs of Spider searches carried out including all possible modifications and amino acid substitutions, were considered for further analysis. The thresholds for peptide and protein identification were set as follows: peptide score\u2009\u2212\u200910lgP\u2009\u2265\u200930, protein score\u2009\u2212\u200910lgP\u2009\u2265\u200940, de novo sequences scores (ALC%)\u2009\u2265\u200980, unique peptides\u2009\u2265\u20092. To ensure that all sources of contamination were considered, the results discussed here are based on the set of proteins which remain after all proteins found in the blanks and control are removed (the unfiltered results are reported in Supplementary Dataset).",
            "The whole dataset was also used for estimating the extent of deamidation, both overall and site specific, using the DeamiDATE tool. The raw MS data were first searched using MaxQuant v.1.6.3.4 with a database made of all positive protein hits from the PEAKS search. Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a fixed modification; oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), pyroglutamic acid (QE), and hydroxyproline were all set as variable modifications. Digestion was set to trypsin with a maximum of two missed cleavages. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% and the minimum score cut-off for modified and unmodified peptides was 50. All other parameters were left for the default for orbitrap mass spectrometers. All laboratory and handling contaminants were removed from the results.",
            "Ancient DNA analysis",
            "The analyses were conducted at the Ancient DNA Laboratory of the Department of Cultural Heritage (University of Bologna), following strict standards for paleogenomic workflow. A second lower left molar was isolated for ancient DNA extraction (SLB2). The tooth was smoothly cleaned with 4% HCl, rinsed in 80% EtOH and then sterilized under UV-light for 20\u2019. 1\u20132\u00a0mm external surface of the root was then abraded with a rotatory blade to remove superficial layer, and 60\u00a0mg of cementum and dentin powder was collected by drilling the root at low speed with dental bit. For metagenomic analysis, a 15\u00a0mg fragment of dental calculus (SLBT) was sampled from the second lower left incisor and after 20\u2019 UV irradiations, it was powdered on sterilized mortar for DNA extraction. DNA isolation was performed as in Dabney et al. (2013) with slight laboratorial modifications as in Cilli et al. (2020) and molecular concentrations were measured on QuBit fluorometer. Blank controls were processed along with the samples during every phase of the analysis. Single stranded libraries were then built for both extracts, pooled at equimolar amounts with other samples and screened for endogenous DNA on HiSeqX Ten 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u00a0bp lane. Once confirmed the presence of authentic ancient DNA, SLB sample was sequenced a second time on HiSeqX Ten 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u00a0bp lane, generating\u2009>\u2009500 million reads.",
            "Raw data were processed with Paleomix: the fastq files were filtered with AdapterRemoval that removed adapters and reads shorter than 30\u00a0bp. Reads were then separately aligned to the Human Reference Genome (GRCh37) and to an elongated version of the rCRS using Circular Mapper v1.93.5 (https://github.com/apeltzer/CircularMapper) and bwa v0.7.17 aln algorithm, with minimum mapping quality\u2009\u2265\u200920, seeds disabled and parameter \u2212\u2009n set to 0.01. PCR duplicates were automatically removed and the authenticity of the reads was confirmed by evaluating the patterns of deamination at both ends of the reads with mapDamage v2.2.1. Modern human contamination was estimated at mitochondrial and X-chromosome level via Schmutzi and ANGSD v0.939 respectively. We used Schmutzi to generate the consensus sequence of the mitochondrial DNA, and the haplogroup was assigned with HaploGrep2 and Haplofind. The\u2014rescale option from mapDamage was used to downscale the quality values of likely-damaged positions of the reads due to ancient DNA damages. Then, a list of informative SNPs for Y-chromosome was downloaded from the International Society of Genetic Geneaology (https://isogg.org/tree/), and the software yhaplo (https://github.com/23andMe/yhaplo) was used to identify Y-chromosome haplogroup from reads with mapping quality scores\u2009\u2265\u200930 and bases with quality scores\u2009\u2265\u200930. Biological sex of the individual was estimated by computing the ratio of reads aligning to the X-chromosome as a portion of the total sequences mapping to the autosomes using the R script provided in Mittnik et al. 2016. The results were also compared with the sex assignment approach provided by Skoglund et al. 2013, that calculates the ratio of reads mapping to Y-chromosome as a portion of the alignments to the sexual chromosomes. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with the software MEGA X using a dataset of 130 Chalcolithic to Middle Late Neolithic Eurasians of haplogroup K (Supplementary Table S5), by setting the substitution model HKY\u2009+\u2009I\u2009+\u2009G, assessed by JModelTest2 and running 1000 bootstrap repetitions. The Median Joining Network (Supplementary Fig. S5) was performed with Network software v.10 (www.fluxus-engineering.com) using default parameters on a set of 53 K1a (n\u2009=\u200919), K1a\u2009+\u2009150 (n\u2009=\u20093), K1a\u2009+\u2009195 (n\u2009=\u200930) and K1f. (n\u2009=\u20091) individuals (Supplementary Table S6). Poly-C stretches, AC-indels at positions 303\u2013315, 515\u2013524, 16,180\u201316,193 and hypervariable position 16,519 were excluded from the phylogenetic reconstruction.",
            "Pseudohaploid genotypes were called from reads with mapping quality\u2009\u2265\u200930 using PileupCaller, (https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools) that randomly selects one high quality base (phred base quality score\u2009\u2265\u200930) based on the 1240\u00a0K reference panel. Minimum base and mapping quality of 30 filters were applied for the samtools mpileup command, and pseudo-haploid data generated by randomly calling one allele from each covered site using the pileupCaller script. For the contextualization of SLB in the ancient Mediterranean variability, a dataset of 905 ancient individuals was selected from the 1240\u00a0K\u2014Human Origins SNP Array (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data). For each of the Mediterranean populations observed in the original dataset, only individuals for a period between the Mesolithic and Bronze Age were selected, excluding all those individuals that were referred to as duplicate, related, contaminated, and low-covered.",
            "A representative panel of 1257 modern individuals to be used as a reference base for the PCA projection was extracted from the HumanOrigins dataset. These contain a lower number of markers (~\u2009600\u00a0K SNPs) but have the advantage of having a good coverage of all populations and of being already merged with the ancients, which simplifies the procedure and avoids further reductions in the number of variants when merging. Therefore, we obtained a comparison panel of 2162 IND and 431,156 SNPs (Supplementary Table S7) from ancient and modern Euro-Mediterranean populations. The data of ancient SLB were then merged with the custom dataset, for a total 92,322 SNPs remaining after further pruning (using a 200 25 0.4 filter). Finally, we did the PCA projection of the ancient individuals with SLB on the modern Euro Mediterranean HOs, and the resulting plots were divided in four temporal screens, namely Mesolithic, Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age (Supplementary Fig. S6).",

            "Genotyping of 20 modern inhabitants of the nearby municipality of San Lorenzo Bellizzi was included in this study. All these samples were selected according to the grandparents and founder surname criteria, to guarantee at least three generations of ancestry in the area, and by excluding related individuals. All the procedures concerning the modern samples were approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Bologna on 08/04/2013. All donors provided a written informed consent to data treatment and project objectives. The study was designed and conducted in agreement with the ethical principles for research involving human subjects stated by the WMA Declaration of Helsinki. Saliva samples were collected with the Oragene-DNA Self Collection Kit OG500 (DNA Genotek Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Genomic DNA was extracted following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and quantified with dsDNA BR Assay Kit and Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).",
            "DNA samples were then genotyped for the 713,014 SNPs included in the HumanOmniExpress BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), in the Center for Biomedical Research & Technologies of the Italian Auxologic Institute (Milan, Italy). The 20 samples were merged with 737 already published individuals, representative of the genetic variability along the Italian peninsula, as well as Sardinia. Merging was performed with the PLINK v.1.9 by taking into consideration only autosomal SNPs that were shared across the two datasets, obtaining a new set of 757 individuals and 254,709 variants. A standard quality control was then carried out with functions implemented in the same PLINK package to ensure a high quality for the resulting final dataset of modern individuals. Specifically, data missingness was checked across SNPs and across individuals with a threshold of 0.05, leaving 254,614 SNPs and 757 individuals; the respect of Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium was also inspected, imposing a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to the standard threshold of 0.01, so that the new threshold is equal to 3.9275e\u22128. Variants in linkage disequilibrium were also tested using a sliding window approach with a window of size 500 SNPs, a step of 50 SNPs and a LD threshold of 0.1 and, if detected, one variant was randomly removed from the dataset. The complete QC returned 49,586 SNPs and 757 individuals. Finally, the dataset (757\u2009+\u2009SLB individual) was projected on the modern genetic background using SmartPCA software from the EIGENSOFT package using lsqproject: YES option.",
            "Microbiome analysis",
            "We applied HOPS for characterizing the metagenomic profile of the shotgun reads. The sequences were first aligned to the database using a modified version of MALT. In particular, the database was created by malt-build using the \u201crepresentative\u201d and \u201creference\u201d bacterial (n\u2009=\u200911,270) and archaeal (n\u2009=\u2009408) genomes downloaded from NCBI RefSeq on November 16, 2020. The reads assigned to bacterial genomes were extracted with the MaltExtract tool and realigned to their respective reference genomes to evaluate edit distances, coverage distributions, and post-mortem DNA damage patterns. To this aim, we used MapDamage to estimate deamination rates. Post-mortem degradation score (PMDS) distributions were computed using PMDtools. The breadth and depth of coverage were estimated using bedtools. Edit distances for all sequences compared to their references were used for calculating the negative difference proportion score (\u2212\u0394 %) as previously described by H\u00fcbler and colleagues (2019). A \u2212\u2009\u0394 %\u2009>\u20090.9 was considered as relevant for a declining distribution related to ancient DNA profile. Taxa with more than 300 assigned reads, more than 50 reads with PMDS\u2009>\u20091,\u2009\u2212\u2009\u0394 %\u2009>\u20090.9 and showing patterns of C-T transition at 5\u2032 were considered to be of ancient origin. The MALT reference database was built using the malt-build command and selecting the \u201crepresentative\u201d and \u201creference\u201d bacterial (n\u2009=\u200911,270) and archaeal (n\u2009=\u2009408) genomes from NCBI RefSeq (November 16, 2020). The same pipeline were used on a dataset of 114 dental calculi derived from previous studies, including Neanderthal, and human from different era (pre-agricultural, neolithic, pre-antibiotic period and modern day humans). Sequencing data have been downloaded from the ENA repository (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) under project accession IDs PRJEB34569 and PRJEB44313. Raw reads from the respective repositories were downloaded and the HOPS pipeline applied using the same parameters listed above. The resulting bacterial counts normalized for sequencing depth were used to perform a PCoA analysis with the Bray\u2013Curtis distance.",
            "Screening of potential bacterial pathogens were also performed, by searching for specific traces of their DNA within the results of the same HOPs pipeline describe above. In particular, we seek for genomic traces of pathogens claimed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as most relevant infectious diseases for human health. We selected those bacteria, whose genomes were included within the HOPS database: Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Borrelia, Brucella, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Escherichia coli, Francisella tularensis, Haemophilus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella, Listeria, Mycobacterium haemophylum, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Serratia marcescens, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptocossus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Treponema pallidum, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pestis.

            "Hominins with morphology similar to present-day humans appear in the fossil record across Eurasia between 40,000 and 50,000 y ago. The genetic relationships between these early modern humans and present-day human populations have not been established. We have extracted DNA from a 40,000-y-old anatomically modern human from Tianyuan Cave outside Beijing, China. Using a highly scalable hybridization enrichment strategy, we determined the DNA sequences of the mitochondrial genome, the entire nonrepetitive portion of chromosome 21 (\u223c30 Mbp), and over 3,000 polymorphic sites across the nuclear genome of this individual. The nuclear DNA sequences determined from this early modern human reveal that the Tianyuan individual derived from a population that was ancestral to many present-day Asians and Native Americans but postdated the divergence of Asians from Europeans. They also show that this individual carried proportions of DNA variants derived from archaic humans similar to present-day people in mainland Asia.",

            "The term \u201cearly modern humans\u201d generally refers to humans who fall within the morphological variation of present-day humans and date to the Middle or Early Upper Paleolithic. The earliest modern humans appear in the Eurasian fossil record about 45,000 y ago, whereas the last remains that tend to be classified as early modern humans are about 25,000 y old (1). Early modern humans may exhibit some archaic features shared with other earlier forms of humans such as Neandertals. Although early modern humans are thus only vaguely defined as a group, their genetic relationship to present-day humans is unclear. Similarly, their relationship to archaic humans is of interest, given that they may have interacted directly with them.",
            "To begin to explore the genetic relationships of early modern humans with present-day humans, we have analyzed a partial human skeleton that was unearthed in 2003, along with abundant late Pleistocene faunal remains, in the Tianyuan Cave near the Zhoukoudian site in northern China, about 50 km southwest of Beijing. The skeleton was radiocarbon-dated to 34,430 \u00b1 510 y before present (BP) (uncalibrated), which corresponds to \u223c40,000 calendar years BP (2). A morphological analysis of the skeleton (3) confirms initial assessments (4) that this individual is a modern human, but suggests that it carries some archaic traits that could indicate gene flow from earlier hominin forms. The Tianyuan skeleton is thus one of a small number of early modern humans more than 30,000 y old discovered across Eurasia (2) and an even smaller number known from East Asia (5).",
            "To evaluate DNA preservation and the degree of modern human contamination in the Tianyuan skeleton, we prepared two DNA extracts from the left femur (TY1301) and two from the right tibia (TY1305) of the human skeleton excavated in Tianyuan Cave (4) using less than 100 mg of bone material per extraction (Table S1). Sequencing of random DNA fragments from DNA libraries constructed from these four extracts revealed that about 0.01\u20130.03% of the DNA in the libraries was of human origin (SI Text, section 1andTable S1). This low percentage of endogenous DNA precludes sequencing of the entire genome of this individual. Thus, we used DNA capture approaches to retrieve the mitochondrial (mt)DNA (6) and nuclear DNA sequences from the Tianyuan individual.",
            "We used a protocol for targeted DNA sequence retrieval that is particularly suited for mtDNA (6) to isolate mtDNA fragments. In total, we sequenced 4,423,607 unique DNA fragments from both ends on the Illumina GAII platform from the four libraries. Of these, 0.1\u20137.7% (Table S1) could be aligned to a human mtDNA reference sequence (7). All four libraries yielded consensus mtDNA sequences that agreed with each other. This is in agreement with the observation of paleontologists that the two bones come from a single individual (2). For estimation of mtDNA contamination and phylogenetic analyses, we used DNA fragments isolated from the femur library that had the highest mtDNA content (Table S1) and yielded an average coverage of 35.6-fold of the mtDNA genome.",
            "When studying modern humans, it is particularly difficult to exclude that DNA from present-day humans might have contaminated the samples or experiments. It has previously been argued (8) that the combination of two observations makes it likely that a DNA library contains a majority of endogenous ancient human DNA: First, that the patterns of DNA degradation, in particular nucleotide misincorporations resulting from deamination of cytosine residues at ends of DNA fragments, indicate that the mtDNA is ancient; and second, that deep sequencing of the mitochondrial genome indicates that the human mtDNA in the library comes from a single individual. We identified 78 distinct DNA fragments that cover three positions where the Tianyuan mtDNA consensus differs from at least 308 of 311 mtDNA genomes from around the world (9). All these fragments carry the consensus base at these positions, indicating that the vast majority [95% confidence interval (CI): 95.3\u2013100%] of the endogenous mtDNA fragments come from a single source (SI Text, section 2). Alignments of the individual mtDNA fragments against the consensus sequence constructed from all fragments reveal C\u2192T and G\u2192A substitution frequencies of between 25 and 30% close to the ends of the DNA fragments (Fig. S1C), an extent of substitution indicative of cytosine deamination not seen in present-day human contamination (8,10). We conclude that the human DNA extracted from the Tianyuan skeleton comes from a single individual and is likely to be endogenous to the skeleton.",
            "We estimated a phylogenetic tree for 311 modern human mtDNAs, the Tianyuan mtDNA, and a complete Neandertal mtDNA (Fig. S2). The Tianyuan mtDNA falls within the variation of present-day human mtDNA. It carries all substitutions that have been used to define a group of related mtDNA sequences\u2014\u201chaplogroup R\u201d\u2014and in addition a deletion of a 9-bp motif (5\u2032-CCCCCTCTA-3\u2032, revised Cambridge reference sequence positions 8,281\u20138,289) as well as a substitution at position 16,189 (Fig. S3A), which together have been used to define a group of related mtDNA sequences, \u201chaplogroup B\u201d (11\u201313), within haplogroup R. In addition, it carries four substitutions (5,348, 5,836, 11,257, 16,293) that are not defining subgroups of haplogroup B (14\u201317). Thus, it is related to the mtDNA that was ancestral to present-day haplogroup B (Fig. 1), which has been estimated to be around 50,000 y old (18) (50. 7 ka BP; 95% CI: 38.1\u201368.3 ka BP). We note that the age of the Tianyuan individual is compatible with this date.",

            "Today, mtDNA of haplogroup B occurs in Native Americans, populations of the Russian Far East, Central Asia, Korea, Taiwan, Melanesia, and Polynesia. It is thus widespread in Asia and America. The fact that an individual who lived in the Beijing area 40,000 y ago carried a mitochondrial genome that is potentially ancestral to mtDNAs in all these areas suggests that there is at least some population continuity from the earliest modern humans in East Asia to present-day populations in these areas. However, although genetic reconstructions of human population histories in Eurasia have relied heavily on mtDNA variation (19\u201321), the extent to which this accurately reflects older population histories in the region is unknown. We therefore proceeded to analyze nuclear DNA sequences of this individual who represents a member of an early population in Asia.",
            "The ability to sequence nuclear DNA sequences from the Tianyuan individual is limited by the fact that no more than 0.03% of the DNA extracted is endogenous to the bone. Previous studies (22\u201324) have shown that hybridization enrichment can be used to obtain nuclear DNA fragments from ancient samples. However, the commercially available hybridization systems used in these studies provide only a limited number of capture probes in each hybridization reaction. Because the enrichment of highly fragmented DNA requires large overlaps between probes, this limits the total size of genomic regions that can be targeted to a few megabases at best. To overcome this limitation, we modified a strategy previously described by Gnirke et al. (25) that uses oligonucleotides synthesized on arrays to construct probe libraries that are then amplified and converted into biotinylated RNA capture probes through in vitro transcription. Our approach differs in that first we use oligonucleotides from arrays with higher probe density (1 million probes per array); second, we exclude most of the linker sequence from oligonucleotide synthesis; third, we combine probe libraries from several arrays into a single \u201csuperprobe library\u201d; and fourth, we use biotinylated DNA instead of RNA probes. This way, we produced a library consisting of 8.7 million different probes tiled at 3-bp intervals across the 29.8 Mbp of all nonrepetitive sequence in chromosome 21 (Fig. S4).",
            "We produced additional DNA extracts and libraries from femur TY1301, this time using uracil DNA glycosylase and endonuclease VIII during library preparation to avoid nucleotide misincorporations induced by deaminated cytosine residues (26). From these libraries as well as the two initial libraries from the femur, we performed two successive enrichments for chromosome 21 fragments (Fig. S5). A total of 789,925 unique DNA fragments was identified that represents 1.75-fold coverage of the targeted regions. Separately, we also enriched for mtDNA by the same approach. This resulted in estimates of the average human mtDNA contamination in these libraries between 0.1% and 3.1% (SI Text, section 3.4). A comparison with shotgun sequencing results for two of the libraries used for capture showed that more than 70% of the total number of target DNA molecules present in the libraries was isolated by the capture procedure (SI Text, section 3.3). Thus, this procedure efficiently captures short molecules in very complex mixtures of DNA.",
            "To investigate the relationship of the Tianyuan individual to present-day populations, we compared it to chromosome 21 sequences from 11 present-day humans from different parts of the world (a San, a Mbuti, a Yoruba, a Mandenka, and a Dinka from Africa, a French and a Sardinian from Europe, a Papuan, a Dai, and a Han from Asia, and a Karitiana from South America) and a Denisovan individual, each sequenced to 24- to 33-fold genomic coverage (27). Denisovans are an extinct group of Asian hominins related to Neandertals (28). In the combined dataset, 86,525 positions variable in at least one individual are of high quality in all 13 individuals.Table 1shows that the Tianyuan individual differs by 21,944\u201323,756 substitutions from the Eurasian individuals, by 30,297\u201335,938 substitutions from the African individuals, and by 43,893 substitutions from the Denisovan individual. Thus, the Tianyuan individual was clearly more similar to present-day humans than to Denisovans, and more similar to present-day Eurasians than to present-day Africans.",
            "Pairwise nucleotide differences among chromosome 21 sequences analyzed",
            "To more accurately gauge how the population from which the Tianyuan individual is derived was related to Eurasian populations, while taking gene flow between populations into account, we used a recent approach (29) that estimates a maximum-likelihood tree of populations and then identifies relationships between populations that are a poor fit to the tree model and that may be due to gene flow. As suggested by the nucleotide differences (Table 1), the maximum-likelihood tree (Fig. S6A) shows that the branch leading to the Tianyuan individual is long, due to its lower sequence quality. However, among Eurasian populations, Tianyuan clearly falls with Asian rather than European populations (bootstrap support 100%). The strongest signal not compatible with a bifurcating tree (Fig. S6B) is an inferred gene-flow event that suggests that 6.7% of chromosome 21 in the Papuan individual is derived from Denisovans, in agreement with previous findings (28,30). When this is taken into account, the Tianyuan individual appears ancestral to all Asian individuals studied (Fig. 2). We note, however, that the relationship of the Tianyuan and Papuan individuals is not resolved (bootstrap support 31%). Further work is necessary to clarify whether this reflects the age of the Tianyuan individual relative to the divergence between modern human populations.",

            "Maximum-likelihood tree relating the chromosome 21 sequences of the Tianyuan individual, 11 present-day humans, and the Denisovan genome. The most strongly supported gene-flow event is shown in yellow. Bootstrap support for all internal edges is 100% except for the edge putting Tianyuan outside the four Asians, which is 31%. The scale bar shows 10 times the average standard error of the entries in the covariance matrix.",
            "It has been shown that a population related to the Denisovan individual contributed genetic material to the ancestors of present-day Melanesians (28,30), and this has also been suggested to be the case for some mainland Asian populations (31) (but see also ref.27). It is therefore of interest to analyze whether the Tianyuan individual shows evidence of any Denisovan genetic contribution. For chromosome 21, we find that any putative admixture from Denisovans must be smaller than that in present-day Papuans and not larger than in other present-day mainland Asians analyzed (SI Text, section 3.7andFig. S6B). However, because archaic admixture may show systematic differences among chromosomes (27), we decided to analyze additional parts of the Tianyuan genome for traces of archaic admixture. To do this, we identified 1,666 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) where both the Neandertal (32) and Denisovan (27) genomes differ from the genomes of individuals from seven African populations in the Foundation Jean Dausset-Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)-Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH) (33), and 1,800 SNPs where the Denisovan genome differs from the Neandertal as well as the seven Africans (SI Text, section 3.7). We synthesized capture probes for these 3,466 sites and generated additional DNA libraries from the Tianyuan individual. After enrichment and sequencing, we identified 834 and 843 sites, respectively, for which data were available for individuals from the HGDP-CEPH and the Tianyuan individual.Fig. 3shows that all non-African populations share more alleles with the two archaic individuals. Over and above the alleles shared with the Neandertal, Melanesians share additional alleles with the Denisovan, as previously described (27,28,30), whereas the Tianyuan individual falls within the range of present-day Eurasian mainland populations. This indicates that the Tianyuan individual is most similar to the latter populations in carrying a genomic component related to the Neandertal genome, but no Denisovan component is discernable with these analyses (see alsoFig. S7).",

The x axis shows the percent of alleles that match the Neandertal and Denisovan genomes at sites where both of these differ from seven Africans, and the y axis indicates the percent of alleles that match the Denisovan genome where this differs from the Neandertal as well as from the seven Africans.",
            "The DNA hybridization capture strategy described here allows sequencing of large sections (>>1 Mbp) of the nuclear genome from mammalian samples even in the presence of a large excess of microbial DNA, a situation typical of almost all ancient samples outside permafrost regions. This opens the possibility of generating DNA sequences from previously inaccessible ancient samples. We use this capture strategy to analyze an early modern human, the Tianyuan individual, who contains less than 0.03% endogenous DNA.",
            "The results show that early modern humans present in the Beijing area 40,000 y ago were related to the ancestors of many present-day Asians as well as Native Americans. However, they had already diverged from the ancestors of present-day Europeans.",
            "That Europeans and East Asians had diverged by 40,000 y ago is consistent with dates for the first archaeological appearance of modern humans in Europe and also with the upper end of an estimate [23 ka BP (95% CI: 17\u201343 ka BP)] for the divergence of East Asian and European populations from nuclear DNA variation in present-day populations (34). The results also show that the Tianyuan individual did not carry any larger proportion of Neandertal or Denisovan DNA sequences in its genome than present-day people in the region. More analyses of additional early modern humans across Eurasia will further refine our understanding of when and how modern humans spread across Eurasia.",
            "The libraries used for mitochondrial capture and shotgun sequencing were produced from 20 \u03bcL of each extract as described (35) without enzymatic removal of deaminated cytosines (uracils) (Table S1). Both library adapters (P5 and P7) carried a 4-bp \u201cclean-room key\u201d sequence (5\u2032-GTCT-3\u2032) that is used exclusively for ancient DNA (36). In addition, sample-specific barcodes were introduced into both library adaptors during amplification (35), which was performed using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems).",

When this did not result in a genotype call, we considered the two most likely homozygous genotypes and called the most likely one if their difference in Phred score was at least 50. The sites that are variable in 13 individuals were converted to TreeMix (29) input (SI Text, section 3.5). To compute pairwise distances, we restricted the analysis to 86,525 sites where a haploid or diploid genotype was called in all individuals, and not more than one nonreference allele was called across all individuals.

            "Being at the western fringe of Europe, Iberia had a peculiar prehistory and a complex pattern of Neolithization. A few studies, all based on modern populations, reported the presence of DNA of likely African origin in this region, generally concluding it was the result of recent gene flow, probably during the Islamic period. Here, we provide evidence of much older gene flow from Africa to Iberia by sequencing whole genomes from four human remains from northern Portugal and southern Spain dated around 4000 years BP (from the Middle Neolithic to the Bronze Age). We found one of them to carry an unequivocal sub-Saharan mitogenome of most probably West or West-Central African origin, to our knowledge never reported before in prehistoric remains outside Africa. Our analyses of ancient nuclear genomes show small but significant levels of sub-Saharan African affinity in several ancient Iberian samples, which indicates that what we detected was not an occasional individual phenomenon, but an admixture event recognizable at the population level. We interpret this result as evidence of an early migration process from Africa into the Iberian Peninsula through a western route, possibly across the Strait of Gibraltar.",

            "Modern European populations show a southwest-northeast gradient of African diversity with its maximum in Spain [1,2]. It is unclear if this gradient is the consequence of ancient prehistoric contacts or, instead, if it is owing to African migrations into Europe during historical times. Based on genome-wide data from modern populations, African admixture has been estimated to around the time of the Muslim expansion into Iberia [2,3]. However, analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosomes in modern individuals suggest a much older admixture event, possibly dated around 10 000\u20138000 years before present (yBP), [4\u20136]. One of the strongest pieces of evidence is the existence of mitochondrial haplotypes belonging to the sub-Saharan L macro-haplogroup that form European-specific subclades, suggesting they have evolved locally in Europe [5\u20137].",
            "Ancient DNA (aDNA) is a powerful resource to reconstruct events in demographic history [8\u201310]. Studies of prehistoric human remains from Morocco [11,12] and Spain [13] reported genomic evidence of gene flow from Iberia into Late Neolithic Moroccans around 5000 yBP, but none of these works detected admixture in the opposite direction, i.e. from Africa into Iberia. However, all these studies considered a limited number of captured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which may not be powerful enough to detect limited levels of gene flow that happened long ago. Also, these studies used ancient Maghrebians as the potential source of African admixture, and hence may not be a good proxy if the gene flow had a sub-Saharan origin.",

We found one sample from Andalusia (southern Spain) to carry the sub-Saharan mitochondrial haplogroup L2a1, to our knowledge never observed before in ancient human remains outside Africa. In addition, the analyses of the ancient nuclear genomes revealed an increased similarity between Middle Neolithic/Chalcolithic (MN/ChL) samples from Spain and ancient sub-Saharan remains. To our knowledge, this study reports for the first time, both at nuclear and mitochondrial level, direct evidence of prehistoric northbound gene flow from Africa into Europe, probably following a trans-Mediterranean western route.",

Samples were preferentially taken from teeth and petrous bone, when available, and all remains were decontaminated by physical removal of the surfaces and ultraviolet treatment before extraction. DNA was extracted following the protocols from [14,15]. One Illumina library was built from each sample, either as single or double stranded (following [16] and [17], respectively) depending on their latitude of origin and storage conditions after excavation. Libraries preserving less than 20% of endogenous DNA were subjected to capture enrichment (electronic supplementary material, table S2).",
            "We followed two different strategies for the capture experiments: (i) we used capture on array as described in [18] to recover complete mitochondrial genomes from eight samples; and (ii) we developed an in-solution WGC protocol to recover whole genomes and complete mitogenomes from five ancient samples, includingCOV20126. This protocol is based on homemade probes built from commercial male human DNA (PROMEGA). Similar to [19], the commercial DNA is sonicated to an average fragment size of 100\u2013200 bp and then ligated to biotinylated adapters. The sequence of the adapters is different to that of the Illumina oligos, which prevents amplification or sequencing of the baits after capture. Following WGC, we obtained an enrichment in nuclear sequences ranging from 2 up to 12-fold (electronic supplementary material, table S2).

All called variants were confirmed by visual inspection using Tablet[23]. Also, inCOV20126, we repeated the analysis after usingpmdtools, which restricts the haplogroup assignment to reads showing the typical aDNA pattern of damage [24].

Then, the chosen alleles were duplicated to form homozygous genotypes. We used PLINK [30] to merge these calls to reference ancient and modern datasets from [31]. Also, we realigned bam files and mapped raw read data from recently published ancient remains [10,11,13,32,33].

The restriction of the analysis to reads showing typical aDNA molecular damage [24], confirmed the assignation ofCOV20126to haplogroup L2a1 l. We followed PhyloTree(http://www.phylotree.org/) to placeCOV20126in a parsimonious phylogeny of the L2 haplogroup (electronic supplementary material, figure S5a) and confirmed its assignment to L2a1. Within this clade, the polymorphisms 16189C and 16192 T together with 534 T placeCOV20126further down on the tree in subclade L2a1 l, although for a complete assignment to this subcladeCOV20126is missing an A at position 143 and a C at position 195. On the same branch of the tree and differing from L2a1 l by only four substitutions, there is L2a1 k, a haplogroup that perhaps has evolved locally in Europe since 13 000 yBP [5,6]. We did not find exact matches to this ancient sequence in a database of modern haplogroup L mtDNAs (n> 2600 haplotypes). However, in present-day populations haplogroup L2a1 l is most frequent in West/West-Central Africa [41], but also in the Caribbean and USA, as a consequence of the transatlantic slave trade, [42]. Most remarkable, the sub-clade, L2a1l2a, comprising five different haplotypes, occurs only in modern DNA samples from Poland [43].

All ancient individuals were projected onto the first two principal components defined by modern genomes (figure\u00a01b). Our Iberian samples cluster together with other Chalcolithic Iberians.COV20126is just slightly shifted on the plot towards samples previously described as carrying a Caucasian component in their genomes (ancient individuals from the Russian Steppes and Late Neolithic and BA samples from central Europe), and shows no obvious increased affinity with Africa.",

Based on cross-validation error, the best-supported value ofKisK= 6 (electronic supplementary material, figure S3).

AtK= 7, a minor fraction of a genome component associated with the Caucasian hunter\u2013gatherers (CHG) and Russian Steppes is evident inCOV20126, as well as in two Spanish samples from the same BA period [13,47] (figure\u00a01c; electronic supplementary material, data S3). The presence of this component only inCOV20126, i.e. the most recent individual we analysed in the present study, is in agreement with previous work reporting a late arrival of the Pontic Steppe ancestry into the Iberian gene pool [9,46,48,49].",

In short, clustering analyses do not yield any obvious indication of genomic relationships between Africans andCOV20126, which could corroborate the findings of the mtDNA analysis.",
            "The low coverage of some ancient individuals,COV20126among them, strongly reduced the number of available markers in the previous analysis, and hence our power to detect subtle signals of remote admixture events. Therefore, we decided to use the whole-genome sequences we had generated to formally test for admixture with a sub-Saharan source.",
            "We ranD-statistics [39] in ANGSD [40] using the chimpanzee genome as outgroup. The null hypothesis was that, in the absence of gene flow from Africa, all ancient Iberian samples should form a single cluster, to the Africans' exclusion. Alternatively, African admixture in Iberia after the Mesolithic period would result in negative values ofD. Thus, we formulatedD-statistics of the formD((Iberian_N/BA, La Bra\u00f1a) African, chimpanzee) (figure\u00a03), where Iberian_N/BA was represented in turn by each of the Early Neolithic, Middle Neolithic and BA samples (electronic supplementary material, data S2) and La Bra\u00f1a is a WHG from Northern Spain, known to have contributed genetically to post-Mesolithic populations in Western Europe [10,13,47,50].",

La Bra\u00f1a is a representative WHG from Spain, and the South African source was fixed in each set of comparisons to be one of the ancient sub-Saharan samples (dated around 2000 yBP on the left panels and around the Iron Age (approx. 500 yBP) on the right ones) in our whole-genome dataset (electronic supplementary material, data S2).D-values with \u2223Z\u2223 \u2265 3 are highlighted in blue. We observe a trend to negative values ofD, which is indicating gene flow from the African source into the Iberian post-Mesolithic samples. The only exception isCOV20126, which is less similar to the African source than La Bra\u00f1a is. (Online version in colour.)",
            "Rather surprisingly, the only positive set ofD-values obtained from these analyses was observed forCOV20126. Most remarkable is that, in contrast with the null hypothesis, we found most of the tests involving the other ancient Iberian genomes to yield negative values ofD(figure\u00a03and Test1A in the electronic supplementary material, table S4), suggesting the presence of a subtle but significant African component. There is a general trend to negativeD-values, with the Spanish Middle Neolithic and Chalcolithic samples showing greater (and statistically significant) similarities with the African genomes, than the Spanish Early Neolithic and Portuguese Middle Neolithic individuals (whoseD-values are insignificant). A similar trend towards negative values ofDwas not observed when we repeated the test with a configuration of the formD((WHG, La Bra\u00f1a) African, chimpanzee) (Test1B in the electronic supplementary material, table S4), neither with a time series of ancient samples from east Europe (WHG and post-Mesolithic samples from Hungary and Romania, Test2 in the electronic supplementary material, table S4). In the latter case,D-values fluctuated around 0, with no visible difference between earlier and later individuals.",
            "In order to test whether the lack of African ancestry inCOV20126could be explained by its lower genome coverage (0.4\u00d7) compared with other samples (greater than or equal to 1\u00d7), we artificially diminished the quality of the other BA individual (esp005) in ourD-statistics test. We subsampled its genome and increased the presence of contaminant sequences to similar values of those inCOV20126(0.4\u00d7 of genome coverage and \u2248 2,5% of contamination). When we repeated theD-test, despite such modifications, the low-quality version of esp005's genome was still giving signals of African admixture (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). Thus, it seems the low genome coverage cannot by itself explain the apparent absence of African admixture inCOV20126's nuclear sequences.",

This analysis confirmed that all our four samples have the highest levels of shared genetic history with other Middle and Early Neolithic samples from Central Europe and Spain, and with Basques and Sardinians among modern populations (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). However, we detected differences concerning the WHG component. While the Spanish Mesolithic Chan and La Bra\u00f1a are within the WHG that share the most genetic drift with the Portuguese LD1174 and LD270 (f3= 0.271), they are less related with the samples from southern Spain (f3values around 0.25 for LU339 andCOV20126), which share a higher genetic drift with hunter\u2013gatherers from France and Luxembourg than with the Spanish ones (figure\u00a04). This could indicate pre-existing genetic structure within the Iberian hunter-gatherer populations, even though the small differences among the outgroupf3values call for caution in their interpretation.",

Samples from this study are highlighted in orange (southern Iberia) and blue (northern Iberia). (Online version in colour.)",
            "In this study, we found indisputable evidence of the presence of a mitochondrial sequence of sub-Saharan African origin in a 3600 years-old sample,COV20126, from southern Spain. Considering the absence of any closely related mitogenomes in prehistoric Europe, it is difficult to explain this finding by a process other than cross-Mediterranean gene flow before the BA.",
            "AlthoughCOV20216's nuclear genome showed no obvious traces of African admixture, several other samples from Iberia did; in particular, relatively late samples (from the Middle Neolithic and Chalcolithic) collected along the Mediterranean area and on the Spanish plateau. The increased, significant similarity to sub-Saharan African samples shown by these individuals is not matched, as far as we could test, elsewhere in Europe (figure\u00a03and electronic supplementary material, table S4).",
            "Also, we detected a higher African affinity in the Middle Neolithic Spanish samples than in the Portuguese ones, or in individuals from earlier periods. This fits well with archaeological data, reporting similarities in Neolithic tools and pottery decoration (Almagra and the impressed Oran) between the Andalusian and North African shores [51,52].",
            "Taken together, these findings can be explained by at least one episode of gene flow from Africa to southern Iberia, which apparently did not reach (or had a smaller impact on) the northwest Atlantic fringe. The exact date of this episode is difficult to define with confidence. In principle, if it happened in Middle Neolithic times (i.e. a little more than 3600 years ago, which isCOV20126age), its consequences should be evident in the clustering analysis of samples from that period and geographical area, which was not the case. An alternative possibility is that gene flow may have occurred even earlier in Southern Iberia from a population with Sub-Saharan African features, which left some genetic contribution in the genomes of the people, the local hunter\u2013gatherers, they admixed with. Because hunter\u2013gatherer genomes from Southern Spain are not available yet, the consequences of such gene flow become apparent to us only in samples from Middle Neolithic times, in parallel with the reemergence of the local hunter\u2013gatherer component of ancient European genomes [9,46,47]. This hypothesis implies the existence of some north\u2013south genetic structure in pre-Neolithic Iberia, with hunter\u2013gatherers from the south showing a stronger resemblance with sub-Saharan Africans, and it would account for all findings of the present study, as well as for those of previous studies of modern DNA [1,7]. However, to safely discriminate between the two hypotheses, we would need Mesolithic samples from southern Spain, which are at present unavailable.",
            "Whatever the date of gene flow from Africa might be, the presence of African affinities in several individuals, including a clearly African mitogenome, shows that one or more contacts occurred between prehistoric Iberian populations and a population whose features we can describe as sub-Saharan. Whether that happened in a single episode, or two (accounting for the African affinities in, respectively, Spanish MN/ChL samples, andCOV20126), we cannot tell at present. In both cases, the episode(s) we detected left a small, but not negligible, mark at the population level, contributing to a fraction, if minor, of the Iberian gene pool.",
            "With regards to the lack of this signal in the nuclear genome ofCOV20126, it may be related with his younger age compared to the other samples in theD-statistic test and, possibly, with his geographical origin.COV20126's age (3600 yBP) implies a higher number of generations separating him from the time of the admixture event, which could have further diluted the African component within his genome. Additionally, his geographical proximity to the Mediterranean coast (a major point of arrival of prehistoric migrations [53]), may have increased the presence of DNA variants from different sources inCOV20126's ancestors, in comparison with other BA people from the more isolated northern inland regions (esp005). Also, we cannot exclude that technical reasons related with the capture enrichment could have introduced some bias inCOV20126's genomic data. The commercial DNA we used to build the probes comes from anonymous donors and the manufacturer does not provide information about their geographical origin. If most of this DNA is of European ancestry, it may have favoured the capture of European-like, rather than African-like, sequences inCOV20126's genome.",
            "Finally, our study highlights the informative value of mtDNA as a marker of demographic events, which may be difficult to recognize at the genomic level. Indeed, in the long run, recombination is expected to blur the signals of past admixture events, which may instead be preserved in non-recombining DNA fragments (even though the latter are subjected to a stronger impact of genetic drift). Also, these results show that genetic population structure is often complex, and hence broad generalizations about vast territories or long periods of time are unwarranted, if not adequately supported by detailed geographical and archaeological data. Particularly, in the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish plateau and the Cantabrian Mountains seem to have played a major role, reducing the possibility of ancient contacts between the Atlantic and Mediterranean watersheds.",

            "Because of the time and cost associated with Sanger sequencing of complete human mtDNA genomes, practically all evolutionary studies have screened samples first to define haplogroups and then either selected a few samples from each haplogroup, or many samples from a particular haplogroup of interest, for complete mtDNA genome sequencing. Such biased sampling precludes many analyses of interest. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing platforms to generate, rapidly and inexpensively, 109 complete mtDNA genome sequences from random samples of individuals from three Filipino groups, including one Negrito group, the Mamanwa. We obtained on average \u223c55-fold coverage per sequence, with <1% missing data per sequence. Various analyses attest to the accuracy of the sequences, including comparison to sequences of the first hypervariable segment of the control region generated by Sanger sequencing; patterns of nucleotide substitution and the distribution of polymorphic sites across the genome; and the observed haplogroups. Bayesian skyline plots of population size change through time indicate similar patterns for all three Filipino groups, but sharply contrast with such plots previously constructed from biased sampling of complete mtDNA genomes, as well as with an artificially constructed sample of sequences that mimics the biased sampling. Our results clearly demonstrate that the high-throughput sequencing platforms are the methodology of choice for generating complete mtDNA genome sequences.",
            "The increasing availability of complete mtDNA genome sequences from humans has greatly refined the human mtDNA phylogenetic tree and provided new insights into the phylogeography of particular haplogroups (Barnabas et al. 2006;Torroni et al. 2006;Abu-Amero et al. 2007;Derenko et al. 2007;Gonder et al. 2007;Fagundes et al. 2008;Soares et al. 2008;Perego et al. 2009). Such studies typically try to make inferences about population history based on the age of haplogroups (estimated from the number of mutations that have accumulated among mtDNA lineages belonging to the haplogroup) and their geographic distribution. However, making demographic inferences about populations (such as population size changes, population divergence times, migration/admixture events, etc.) from phylogeographic studies is problematic because different phylogenies can arise under the same demographic history, and vice versa (Nielsen and Beaumont 2009). Some studies equate ages of haplogroups with ages of populations, even though a haplogroup that arose a long time ago may have been introduced into a population only recently. Moreover, the method commonly employed to estimate the age of mtDNA haplogroups, namely, the \u201c\u03c1\u201d statistic, has been shown to often give misleading results for simulated data (Cox 2008).",
            "Methods do exist for making demographic inferences from molecular genetic data (Drummond et al. 2002;Hey and Nielsen 2004), but a key requirement of such methods is that the genetic data should be from a random sample of individuals from the population. However, because of the expense and time needed to sequence complete mtDNA genomes with Sanger sequencing technology, previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences have generally either first screened samples by sequencing hypervariable segments of the mtDNA control region and/or genotyping coding region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to classify haplogroups and then selecting one or two samples from each haplogroup for complete mtDNA genome sequencing, or have sequenced many samples from one particular haplogroup of interest in order to investigate the phylogeography of that haplogroup. Such sampling is biased and thus not suitable for demographic inference with existing methods.",
            "Recently, methods have been developed for high-throughput, low-cost sequencing of many complete mtDNA genomes, using a parallel tagged sequencing approach and high-throughput (HT) sequencing platforms (Meyer et al. 2007,2008b). Here, we have applied this approach and obtained 109 complete mtDNA genome sequences from random samples of individuals from three ethnolinguistic groups from the Philippines. Various analyses attest to the accuracy of the sequences generated by the high-throughput approach. Moreover, there are striking differences between Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) of population size change through time constructed for our random samples of mtDNA genome sequences and previous such analyses based on biased samples (Atkinson et al. 2008), and we show that biased sampling can produce similar differences. Our results illustrate the value of random sampling of complete mtDNA genome sequences that can be obtained with the HT platforms and demonstrate that large-scale samples of complete mtDNA genome sequences can be obtained rapidly and efficiently with the HT platforms.",
            "The samples for this study come from three Filipino groups and include 26 Surigaonons, 44 Manobo, and 39 Mamanwa (a Negrito group). All samples were initially prepared for sequencing on the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) GS and GS FLX (hereafter referred to as GS/FLX) platforms, and sequences were obtained for 92 samples. For these, 95% of the resulting reads were assigned to tags, and 83.7% of the untagged reads mapped to the rCRS, with an average length of 222.4 bp. Any nucleotide position in a sequence with less than twofold coverage was automatically called an N, to denote missing data; our goal was to limit the number of such positions to <1% of the sequence for each individual. However, even though 113,045 reads were obtained in total with the GS/FLX, some individuals still did not have sufficient coverage. Furthermore, we observed numerous inconsistencies in homopolymer regions. Homopolymer regions are known to pose a problem with the GS/FLX sequencing technology as the exact number of bases in a run of three or more identical bases cannot be determined because of inaccuracy in the light signal intensity (Green et al. 2008).",
            "Because of the abovementioned issues with the GS/FLX data, we switched to the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform (hereafter referred to as GAII), since it has a much higher throughput and does not have problems sequencing homopolymers. Two GS/FLX pools were converted into GAII libraries and sequenced with the GAII. One pool was sequenced on one lane of the GAII with 51 cycles, with sequences read in one direction only. A total of 4,486,376 reads were obtained, of which 67% of reads were correctly tagged and 70% of the untagged reads mapped to the rCRS. The other pool was also sequenced on one lane with 51 cycles, except sequences were read in both directions. A total of 7,579,656 reads were obtained, of which 54% of the reads were correctly tagged and 43% of sequences mapped to the rCRS. The percentage of GAII reads that were correctly tagged and mapped is thus lower than that for the GS/FLX platform, which is to be expected since quality filtering was used before untagging and mapping for the GS/FLX data as described previously (Green et al. 2008) but not for the GAII data.",
            "In order to call the base at a nucleotide position, we required a minimum of two reads for that position that would then have to agree. For positions with more than two reads, a scoring system (implemented in the MIA assembler) was used in which a consensus (majority) nucleotide was assigned to each position based on all of the reads covering that position from that sample. Reads that matched the consensus nucleotide received a score of +200, while reads that did not match the consensus nucleotide received a score of \u2212600. These scores were then summed, and if the total score was less than 0, an N was assigned to that position. For the purposes of further analysis, sequences were required to have not more than 165 Ns (i.e., <1% missing data). In actuality, the number of Ns per sequence (Supplemental Table S2) ranged from 0 to 113, with an average of 9.9 Ns (i.e., 0.06% missing data) per sequence. The average coverage for the 109 sequences in the final data set was 54.6 (range 9\u2013114), with average minimum coverage of 15.0 (range 2\u201338) and average maximum coverage of 91.4 (range 24\u2013163), as shown inFigure 1and Supplemental Table S2. Most positions were thus covered more than the minimum requirement of twofold; in total, there were 1424 positions in 23 sequences with only twofold coverage, or 0.4% of all positions in these 23 sequences (Supplemental Table S2).",

            "We compared the HV1 sequences obtained by Sanger sequencing and called with the SeqScape software to the HV1 sequences obtained from the HT platforms, and found three discrepancies (Table 1). For these discrepant positions, the coverage for the HT platforms was 22\u201368-fold, while the coverage from Sanger sequencing was twofold to sixfold. For two samples visual inspection of the Sanger sequencing trace files would lead to the same call as the HT platforms, while for the third sample the sequence quality was too poor at this position to call visually. Thus, the discrepancies for these three sequences can be attributed to problems with the SeqScape software. Overall, the HT platforms seem to give more reliable results, which is expected given the higher coverage that can be obtained with these platforms.",

The ratio of transitions to transversions was higher for the coding region (32.3) than for the control region (13.0), but not significantly so (P= 0.09). There were significantly more variable positions in the control region and significantly fewer in the 16S rRNA gene and in the tRNA genes than expected, based on the length of each gene/region (Fig. 2). These are all familiar patterns in mtDNA genome sequences and further attest to the accuracy of the sequences (Pereira et al. 2009).",

The most extreme values were observed forMT-ATP6, with 10 nonsynonymous and seven synonymous changes (pN/pS= 0.67), andMT-ND4, with one nonsynonymous and 20 synonymous changes (pN/pS= 0.02); whenMT-ATP6andMT-ND4are removed from the analysis, thepN/pSratios do not vary significantly among the remaining 11 genes (P= 0.23).",

It should be noted that only rarely did a sequence in this study match the sequence for the assigned haplogroup exactly, so sequences were assigned to the closest haplogroup for which the sequence contained all mutations that define the haplogroup. Interestingly, many of the new lineages within a haplogroup show population specificity. For example, sequences from all three populations were assigned to haplogroup E1a1a1 (Fig. 4). However, only one Mamanwa sequence actually matched haplogroup E1a1a1 exactly. The other sequences had additional mutations that defined five new lineages within haplogroup E1a1a1: three were found exclusively in nine Manobo, one was found exclusively in four Mamanwa, and one (with two sub-branches) was found exclusively in three Surigaonon. Thus, even though haplogroup E1a1a1 is found in all three populations, the novel lineages within this haplogroup are completely population-specific. This same pattern (i.e., a haplogroup shared between populations, but lineages within the haplogroup exhibiting population specificity) is exhibited by several haplogroups.",

However, we found two novel haplogroups, designated provisionally here as M* and N*. Sequences assigned to haplogroup M* (Fig. 4) share some mutations with haplogroup M4, but do not have the basal mutation (12007) defining that haplogroup; therefore, the sequences were not assigned to M4. These M* sequences were observed in two Mamanwa and one Surigaonon. Haplogroup N* branches directly from the base of macrohaplogroup N (Fig. 5) and was observed in one Manobo and, strikingly, 14 Mamanwa. This novel N* haplogroup thus accounts for 36% of Mamanwa mtDNA sequences.",
            "In order to estimate the divergence time of the novel M* and N* haplogroups, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis in BEAST. The topology for macrohaplogroup N (Fig. 5) involves a trifurcation leading to haplogroups N*, Y2a, and R, and different runs in BEAST gave different branching orders for these three branches. However, the Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests in PAUP* (Kishino and Hasegawa 1989;Shimodaira and Hasegawa 2001) indicate that there are no significant differences among all possible topologies for these three branches. The resulting dates for the divergence of N* are from 55,000 to 60,000 yr ago, with a 95% HPD (the lower and upper bound of the 95% highest posterior density interval) range of \u223c44,000\u201372,500 yr ago. The age of the divergence of the M* haplogroup was similarly estimated from the age of macrohaplogroup M to be 47,862 yr ago (95% HPD = 39,907\u201359,236 yr). The analysis with a normally distributed prior for the mutation rate and the root of the tree resulted in an estimated mutation rate of 1.637 \u00d7 10\u22128(95% HPD = 9.9 \u00d7 10\u22129\u20132.41 \u00d7 10\u22128), similar to previous estimates (Atkinson et al. 2008). In this analysis, the root of the tree was estimated to be 150,277 yr old (95% HPD = 90,716\u2013217,514), in accordance with previous estimates (Endicott et al. 2009).",
            "A strategy that is frequently used to select samples for complete mtDNA genome sequencing is to first sequence HV1, and then select individuals with different HV1 sequences for complete mtDNA genome sequencing (Derenko et al. 2007;Friedlaender et al. 2007). The underlying assumption is that individuals with identical HV1 sequences will also have identical, or nearly identical, coding region sequences. To investigate this assumption, we plotted the number of differences in HV1 sequences versus the number of differences in the coding sequences between each pair of individuals (Fig. 6). Of the pairwise comparisons with no differences in the HV1 sequences, 62.5% of these had one or more differences in the coding region, up to a maximum of 11 differences (Fig. 6). Thus, there can be appreciable coding region variation among individuals with identical HV1 sequences.",

            "In order to estimate population size change through time, we carried out a Bayesian analysis (Drummond et al. 2005). The results of this analysis are depicted as a plot of population size change throughout time, termed a Bayesian skyline plot (BSP). The BSPs for the Mamanwas, Manobos, and Surigaonons are generally similar (Fig. 7A\u2013C), and indicate population growth from 50 thousand yr ago (kya) until \u223c30\u201335 kya, followed by population stasis until \u223c6\u20138 kya, at which point population size decreases. The Surigaonons differ from the other groups in showing another signal of population growth, beginning \u223c2\u20133 kya. Assuming a generation time of 25 yr, the current estimates of effective population size would be about 500 for the Mamanwa and Manobo, and 4000 for the Surigaonon.",
            "",
            "Bayesian skyline plots. They-axis for each plot is the product of the effective population size and the generation time. (A) Mamanwa; (B) Manobo; (C) Surigaonon; (D) biased sample consisting of 28 sequences, each from a different haplogroup or lineage within a haplogroup.",
            "The BPSs for these three Filipino groups differ markedly from those for other human populations that were also based on complete mtDNA genome sequences, and which tend to show strong signals of population growth throughout the past 50,000 yr or so (Atkinson et al. 2008). A possible reason for this discrepancy is that previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences suffer from biased sampling, as described above. To investigate if such biased sampling could influence the BSP analysis, we mimicked this sort of sampling by selecting 28 sequences, each from a different haplogroup (or lineage within a haplogroup) from our data and carrying out the BSP analysis. The resulting BSP (Fig. 7D) differs dramatically from the BSPs for the individual Filipino populations (Fig. 7A\u2013C): there is not only a much stronger signal of initial population growth extending from 50 kya to 35 kya, but another signal of growth beginning around 10 kya and no subsequent signal of population decrease. Moreover, the current estimated effective population size for the biased sample is about 40,000, which is 10\u2013100 times that of the corresponding estimates for the individual populations. Thus, biased sampling can give spurious signals of population growth and incorrect estimates of effective population size in the BSP analysis.",
            "We have used HT sequencing platforms to generate complete mtDNA genome sequences rapidly and efficiently. Although we began the study with the GS FLX platform, we switched to the Illumina GA platform as it provides higher coverage and fewer problems with sequences in homopolymer regions. Ongoing improvements in HT sequencing technologies will undoubtedly increase throughput and sequence accuracy and lower costs. A potential concern with HT platforms is that the error rate per base pair is much higher than with traditional Sanger sequencing (Bentley et al. 2008;Johnson and Slatkin 2008). However, because of the much higher coverage per position obtained with the HT platforms (an average of \u223c55-fold in this study), the accuracy of the resulting sequences is expected to be higher than that for sequences obtained via Sanger sequencing. This was borne out in our study; a comparison of the HV1 sequences obtained via Sanger sequencing versus the HT platforms revealed five discrepancies in 109 individuals (thus, the concordance rate = 99.99%), all of which could be attributed to problems with the base-calling software for the Sanger sequencing.",
            "With the average of \u223c55-fold coverage obtained in this study, no sequence had more than 1% missing data, and on average each sequence had only 0.06% missing data. This level of missing data does not influence any of the analyses carried out here, such as haplogroup assignment, diversity statistics, BEAST and BSP analyses, and the like. However, it is possible that for other applications, such as in forensic casework or disease studies, even less missing data would be desirable. This can readily be achieved by increasing the amount of coverage; for example, sequencing just one sample on one lane of the Illumina GA platform can produce up to 16,000-fold coverage of the mtDNA genome (He et al. 2010). However, because of heteroplasmy in mtDNA genomes (Li et al. 2010), some Ns will always be present.",
            "There are two potential limitations of the approach used here to generate complete mtDNA genome sequences. The first is the use of long-range PCR products as the sequencing template, which requires high-quality DNA. However, capture-based methods can be used to generate sequencing libraries enriched for mtDNA sequences (He et al. 2010), even from low-quality DNA. The second potential limitation is the higher error rate per base pair, as discussed above. Although increasing coverage will in general result in more accurate sequences, there are other steps that should be taken to ensure accurate sequences, especially when coverage happens to be low; these include requiring reads from both strands, as discussed in more detail elsewhere (Li et al. 2010).",
            "A further advantage of the HT platforms is that they enable unbiased, population-based sequencing of complete mtDNA genomes, as compared to the biased sampling that characterizes practically all previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences. In sum, these advantages clearly establish HT platforms as the methodology of choice for generating complete mtDNA genome sequences.",
            "Overall, the patterns of mtDNA variation revealed in this study are similar to those observed in previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences (Ingman and Gyllensten 2001;Kivisild et al. 2006;Pereira et al. 2009). In particular, we observed a significant excess of variable positions in the control region (Fig. 2), which can be attributed to weaker functional constraints, as it is the major noncoding region of the mtDNA genome. There was also a significant deficiency of variable positions in the 16S rRNA and tRNA genes (Fig. 4), consistent with the view that the mitochondrial rRNA and tRNA genes are subject to strong functional constraints and hence exhibit reduced variation. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio was quite high (Table 2); observing these familiar patterns in the HT-generated sequences further enhances confidence in the accuracy of these sequences.",
            "There were a total of 77 nonsynonymous polymorphisms among the 13 protein-coding genes (Table 2). Of particular interest is the significant excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms (relative to the other mtDNA protein-coding genes) in theMT-ATP6gene (Table 2). Previously, an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in theMT-ATP6gene was observed in Siberian populations, and was hypothesized to reflect positive selection for cold adaptation (Mishmar et al. 2003). Subsequent analyses cast doubt on this interpretation, suggesting instead that flaws in the statistical analyses (Kivisild et al. 2006) and/or relaxation of functional constraints (Ingman and Gyllensten 2007) were better explanations for the observed variation inMT-ATP6. While more sophisticated analyses would be required to investigate any putative signal of selection, our observation of an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms inMT-ATP6in Filipino populations further argues against the cold adaptation hypothesis and in favor of relaxation of functional constraints (Ingman and Gyllensten 2007).",
            "Because of the cost and time associated with the traditional Sanger sequencing approach, practically all previous studies of complete human mtDNA genome sequences have been forced to rely on a biased sampling approach. That is, mtDNA variation is first assayed in samples of interest by some other method (typically, obtaining HV1 sequences), and then a limited set of samples (typically, either one from each haplogroup, or several samples from one haplogroup of particular interest) is selected for complete mtDNA genome sequencing. The limitation of this approach is shown by the fact that individuals with identical HV1 sequences can harbor appreciable coding sequence variation (Fig. 6). Thus, a significant advantage of the HT platforms is that they permit unbiased, population-based sampling of complete mtDNA genome sequences.",
            "The importance of such unbiased sampling is amply demonstrated in the BSP analyses of population size changes through time (Fig. 7). Previously, BSP analyses of complete mtDNA genome sequences, obtained via biased sampling, indicated a general pattern of overall population growth that varied in intensity across geographic regions (Atkinson et al. 2008). The BSPs for each of the three individual Filipino populations differ dramatically from this overall pattern, and instead indicate an initial phase of moderate population growth, followed by a long period of constant population size, and then a decline in population size starting 6\u20138 kya (Fig. 7A\u2013C). In contrast, the BSP for an artificially constructed biased sample (Fig. 7D) differs from those for the individual populations and strongly resembles previously published BPSs (Atkinson et al. 2008). Moreover, the final estimate of effective population size is 10\u2013100 times larger for the biased than for the unbiased samples. Thus, biased sampling can have a dramatic impact on this type of demographic analysis, and the conclusions of previous BSP analyses (Atkinson et al. 2008) should be viewed with caution.",
            "The complete mtDNA genome sequences provide new insights into the genetic history and relationships of these three Filipino groups. Of particular interest are the Mamanwa, as they are a Negrito group. Mainly because of their physical characteristics (including short stature, frizzy hair, and dark skin pigmentation), it is generally thought that Filipino Negrito groups are descended from a separate, early migration from Africa to Asia (Omoto 1984;Bellwood 1997;Hill et al. 2006;Thangaraj et al. 2006). However, there is very little in the way of available genetic data to address this issue. In fact, a recent study of 50,000 autosomal SNP data in Asian populations concluded that Filipino Negrito and non-Negrito groups are descended from the same single primary wave of colonization to East Asia (Abdulla et al. 2009).",
            "The complete mtDNA genome sequences reveal that the Mamanwa possess a novel haplogroup, designated here as N*, that branches from the base of the macrohaplogroup N phylogeny. This haplogroup is at high frequency (36%) in the Mamanwa but absent or nearly so in the other two Filipino groups (Fig. 3;Table 4). The estimated divergence time of this haplogroup is \u223c55,000\u201360,000 yr ago, implying that the ancestors of the Mamanwa may have become isolated from the ancestors of the other Filipino groups at about this time. These results may seem at variance with the 50,000 SNP data, which does not indicate a separate history of Negrito and non-Negrito Filipino groups (Abdulla et al. 2009). However, a possible scenario that reconciles the mtDNA genome sequences with the 50,000 autosomal SNP data involves would-be early isolation of the ancestors of Negrito groups from non-Negrito groups, followed by more recent gene flow from non-Negrito groups into Negrito groups, for which there is evidence in both the mtDNA data (as shown by the \u223c60% frequency of mtDNA haplogroups in the Mamanwa that are characteristic of other southeast Asian groups) and the 50,000 SNP data (Abdulla et al. 2009), as well as in Y-chromosome data (Delfin et al. 2010). We are currently obtaining additional data and exploring other analyses to investigate this further. But in any event, the results of this study amply demonstrate the utility and validity of HT platforms for rapid and efficient sequencing of complete human mtDNA genomes, in particular, for providing the random samples of mtDNA genome sequences needed for demographic analyses.",
            "Saliva samples were collected with informed consent, and with the permission and assistance of the Philippines National Commission on Indigenous People, from three groups from northern Mindanao in the Philippines (Fig. 3). Samples were obtained from 39 Mamanwas (a Negrito group) from three villages (Tabasinga, Mabuhay, and Urbistondo); 44 Manobos (a non-Negrito group) from two villages (Talacogon and Sabang Gibong) along the Agusan del Sur River; and 26 Surigaonons (an urban group) from Sitio and Surigao. Two milliliters of saliva was collected from each individual and stored in 2 mL of lysis buffer; DNA was extracted as described previously (Quinque et al. 2006).",

Cycle sequencing was performed with the nested primers L16001 (Cordaux et al. 2003) andH16401(Vigilant et al. 1989) and sequenced in both directions with the BigDye Terminator Kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3700 sequencer. Samples with 16189C, resulting in the \u201cC-stretch,\u201d were sequenced twice in both directions, to ensure at least twofold coverage of each position. Sequences were assembled with SeqScape v2.1.1 (Applied Biosystems) and compared to the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (Andrews et al. 1999).",
            "The entire mtDNA genome was amplified in two overlapping products of \u223c8338 and 8647 bp, using primer pairs L644/H8982 and L8789/H877 (Supplemental Table S1). Long-range PCR was carried out using the Expand Long Range dNTP pack (Roche) and 3 ng of template DNA in a 50-\u03bcL volume, using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The annealing temperature was 68.5\u00b0C for product 1 and 66\u00b0C for product 2. PCR products were purified using SPRI beads (Agencourt) using the manufacturer's instructions. The two PCR products for each individual were mixed in equimolar ratios and nebulized using nebulizers and reagents from the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) GS or GS FLX Library Preparation kit following the manufacturer's instructions. MinElute spin columns (QIAGEN) were used to purify the nebulized DNA, which was then eluted in 20 \u03bcL of elution buffer. About 400 ng of DNA was used for tagging nebulized PCR products with an individual-specific tag sequence, as described previously (Meyer et al. 2008b). The GS and GS FLX libraries were prepared according to the standard manufacturer's protocol, with two modifications that enable higher library yields. The first modification decreases the need to perform titration runs of libraries (Meyer et al. 2008a), and the second allows more DNA to be retrieved at the last step of the protocol (Maricic and Paabo 2009).",
            "All samples were initially prepared for the GS or GS FLX platform in three pools, consisting of the tagged, nebulized PCR products. Two pools were subsequently converted into libraries suitable for sequencing on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform, as described elsewhere (Krause et al. 2010). These libraries were each sequenced on one lane on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II, one with single reads and one with paired end reads; the sequences of the primers used for sequencing are provided in Supplemental Table S1.",
            "All reads were sorted according to tags, and reads that did not contain a correct tag were removed. Complete mtDNA genome sequences were assembled with MIA, an in-house assembler described previously (Briggs et al. 2009), using the rCRS as a reference to which all reads were mapped. A multiple alignment of the consensus sequences obtained with MIA was performed with mafft v6.708b (Katoh et al. 2009). The mtDNA genome sequences have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbersGU733718\u2013GU733826).",

As in Phylotree, positions 309.1C(C), 16182C, 16183C, 16193.1C(C), and 16519 were not used for haplogroup assignment since these are subject to highly recurrent mutations.",
            "Basic descriptive diversity statistics were calculated with dnaSP. MEGA 4 (Kumar et al. 2008) was used to calculate the mean number of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites in each protein-coding gene, using the standard mtDNA amino acid codon table, while mtGENESYN (Pereira et al. 2009) was used to calculate the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations in the protein-coding genes, and the number of mutations in the rRNA genes, tRNA genes, and noncoding regions. ThepN/pSratio for each protein-coding gene was obtained by dividing the number of nonsynonymous mutations per nonsynonymous site by the number of synonymous mutations per synonymous site.",

            "Bayesian skyline plots were produced from the coding region sequences (positions 577\u201316,023) using MCMC sampling in the program BEAST (version 5.1) (Drummond et al. 2002;Drummond and Rambaut 2007). The plots were obtained with a piecewise linear model, and ancestral gene trees were based on the Tamura-Nei substitution model (Tamura and Nei 1993) with invariant sites and a gamma-distributed rate (TrN + I + G). To select a model of nucleotide substitution, PAUP* portable version 4.0d105 (Swofford 2003) was used to generate likelihood scores of different competing models, and MODELTEST version 3.7 (Posada and Crandall 1998) was used to choose the best-fit model. A Bayes factor computed via importance sampling (Newton et al. 1994) indicated that the strict molecular clock could not be rejected and was therefore used for the analysis. We allowed 20 discrete changes in the population history using a coalescent-based tree prior with the linear model in which population size grows and declines between changing points. Each MCMC sample was based on a run of 40,000,000 generations sampled every 4000 steps with the first 4,000,000 generations regarded as burn-in. Three independent runs were made for each population, and a mutation rate of 1.691 \u00d7 10\u22128(Atkinson et al. 2008) was used. Each run was analyzed using the program Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) for independence of parameter estimation and stability of MCMC chains (Drummond and Rambaut 2007).",
            "Phylogenetic trees giving a date for the divergence time of the new N* and M* haplogroups were generated in BEAST for the coding region under the same conditions as described above, but with a constant population size model that was supported by a Bayes factor analysis. The tree was based on seven independent runs of 20,000,000 generations each, sampled every 2000 steps, with the first 2,000,000 generations regarded as burn-in. For this analysis one African Mbenzele sequence (GenBank accession no.AF346996) was used to root the tree. All log files were reviewed in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), and all tree files from the independent runs were combined with a custom Python script and with TreeAnnotator v1.5.1, which is a part of the BEAST package (Drummond and Rambaut 2007). Since there are many reported mutation rates based on external and internal calibrations and different methodologies (Mishmar et al. 2003;Atkinson et al. 2008;Endicott and Ho 2008;Fagundes et al. 2008;Ho and Endicott 2008;Endicott et al. 2009;Soares et al. 2009), phylogenetic trees were also analyzed with a normally distributed prior range for the mutation rate with a mean of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22128and a standard deviation of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22129, and a normally distributed prior range for the age of the root of the tree with a mean of 150,000 yr and a standard deviation of 50,000 yr, which incorporates all TMRCA dates of modern humans reported previously (Endicott et al. 2009).",

            "One of the most enduring and widely debated questions in prehistoric archaeology concerns the origins of Europe\u2019s earliest farmers: Were they the descendants of local hunter-gatherers, or did they migrate from southwestern Asia, where farming began? We recover genome-wide DNA sequences from early farmers on both the European and Asian sides of the Aegean to reveal an unbroken chain of ancestry leading from central and southwestern Europe back to Greece and northwestern Anatolia. Our study provides the coup de gr\u00e2ce to the notion that farming spread into and across Europe via the dissemination of ideas but without, or with only a limited, migration of people.",
            "Keywords:paleogenomics, Neolithic, Mesolithic, Greece, Anatolia",
            "Farming and sedentism first appeared in southwestern Asia during the early Holocene and later spread to neighboring regions, including Europe, along multiple dispersal routes. Conspicuous uncertainties remain about the relative roles of migration, cultural diffusion, and admixture with local foragers in the early Neolithization of Europe. Here we present paleogenomic data for five Neolithic individuals from northern Greece and northwestern Turkey spanning the time and region of the earliest spread of farming into Europe. We use a novel approach to recalibrate raw reads and call genotypes from ancient DNA and observe striking genetic similarity both among Aegean early farmers and with those from across Europe. Our study demonstrates a direct genetic link between Mediterranean and Central European early farmers and those of Greece and Anatolia, extending the European Neolithic migratory chain all the way back to southwestern Asia.",
            "It is well established that farming was introduced to Europe from Anatolia, but the extent to which its spread was mediated by demic expansion of Anatolian farmers, or by the transmission of farming technologies and lifeways to indigenous hunter-gatherers without a major concomitant migration of people, has been the subject of considerable debate. Paleogenetic studies (1\u20134) of late hunter-gatherers (HG) and early farmers indicate a dominant role for migration in the transition to farming in central and northern Europe, with evidence of only limited hunter-gatherer admixture into early Neolithic populations, but increasing toward the late Neolithic. However, the exact origin of central and western Europe\u2019s early farmers in the Balkans, Greece, or Anatolia remains an open question.",
            "Recent radiocarbon dating indicates that by 6,600\u20136,500 calibrated (cal) BCE sedentary farming communities were established in northwestern Anatolia at sites such as Barc\u0131n, Mente\u015fe, and Aktoprakl\u0131k C and in coastal western Anatolia at sites such as \u00c7ukuri\u00e7i and Ulucak, but did not expand north or west of the Aegean for another several hundred years (5).

            "Early Greek Neolithic sites, such as the Franchthi Cave in the Peloponnese, Knossos in Crete, and Mauropigi, Paliambela, and Revenia in northern Greece date to a similar period (7\u20139). The distribution of obsidian from the Cycladic islands, as well as similarities in material culture, suggest extensive interactions since the Mesolithic and a coeval Neolithic on both sides of the Aegean (8). Although it has been argued that in situ Aegean Mesolithic hunter-gatherers played a major role in the \u201cNeolithization\u201d of Greece (7), the presence of domesticated forms of plants and animals indicates nonlocal Neolithic dispersals into the area.",

Genotype Calling for Ancient DNA). Two of the higher-coverage genomes are from Barc\u0131n, south of the Marmara Sea in Turkey, one of the earliest Neolithic sites in northwestern Anatolia (individuals Bar8 and Bar31). On the European side of the Aegean, one genome is from the early Neolithic site of Revenia (Rev5), and the remaining two are from the late and final Neolithic sites of Paliambela (Pal7) and Kleitos (Klei10), dating to \u223c2,000 y later (Table 1). Estimates of mitochondrial contamination were low (0.006\u20131.772% for shotgun data) (Table 1;SI Appendix,SI4. Analysis of Uniparental Markers and X Chromosome Contamination Estimates.).

            "The mtDNA haplogroups of all five Neolithic individuals are typical of those found in central European Neolithic farmers and modern Europeans, but not in European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (1). Likewise, the Y-chromosomes of the two male individuals belong to haplogroup G2a2, which has been observed in European Neolithic farmers (3,10); in \u00d6tzi, the Tyrolean Iceman (11); and in modern western and southwestern Eurasian populations, but not in any pre-Neolithic European hunter-gatherers (12). The mitochondrial haplogroups of two additional less well-preserved Greek Mesolithic individuals (Theo1, Theo5;SI Appendix, Table S6) belong to lineages observed in Neolithic farmers from across Europe; consistent with Aegean Neolithic populations, unlike central European Neolithic populations, being the direct descendants of the preceding Mesolithic peoples who inhabited broadly the same region. However, we caution against over-interpretation of the Aegean Mesolithic mtDNA data; additional genome-level data will be required to identify the Mesolithic source population(s) of the early Aegean farmers.",
            "Sequences in and around genes underlying the phenotypes hypothesized to have undergone positive selection in Europeans indicate that the Neolithic Aegeans were unlikely to have been lactase persistent but carried derivedSLC24A5rs1426654 andSLC45A2rs16891982 alleles associated with reduced skin pigmentation. Because our Aegean samples predate the period when the rs4988235 T-allele associated with lactase persistence in Eurasia reached an appreciable frequency in Europe, around 4 kya (12\u201314), and because this allele remains at relatively low frequencies (<0.15) in modern Greek, Turkish, and Sardinian populations (15), this observation is unsurprising. However, despite their relatively low latitude, four of the Aegean individuals are homozygous for the derived rs1426654 T-allele in theSLC24A5gene, and four carry at least one copy of the derived rs16891982 G-allele in theSLC45A2gene. This suggests that these reduced-pigmentation\u2013associated alleles were at appreciable frequency in Neolithic Aegeans and that skin depigmentation was not solely a high-latitude phenomenon (SI Appendix,SI12. Functional Markers). The derived rs12913832 G-allele in theHERC2domain of theOCA2gene was heterozygous in one individual (Klei10), but all other Aegeans for whom the allelic state at this locus could be determined were homozygous for the ancestral allele, indicating a lack of iris depigmentation in these individuals.",
            "Examination of several SNPs in theTCF7L2gene region indicates that the two Neolithic Anatolian individuals, Bar8 and Bar31, are likely to have carried at least one copy of a haplotype conferring reduced susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D); the Klei10 and Rev5 individuals also carry a tag allele associated with this haplotype. Consistent with these observations, it has been previously estimated that this T2D-protective haplotype, which shows evidence for selection in Europeans, East Asians, and West Africans, originated \u223c11,900 y ago in Europe (16).",

Interestingly, we observe derived states for six of eight loci in a protein\u2013protein interaction network inferred to have undergone concerted positive selection 2.6\u20131.2 kya in Europeans (17), suggesting that any recent selection on these loci acted on standing variation present at already appreciable frequency (SI Appendix,SI12.

            "PCA of modern reference populations (18,19) and projected ancient individuals. The Greek and Anatolian samples reported here cluster tightly with other European farmers close to modern-day Sardinians; however, they are clearly distinct from previously published Caucasian hunter-gatherers (20). This excludes the latter as a potential ancestral source population for early European farmers and suggests a strong genetic structure in hunter-gatherers of Southwest Asia. Central and East European (C./E. European), South European (South Eur.). Ancient DNA data: Pleistocene hunter-gatherer (Plei. HG) (20,21,22), Holocene hunter-gatherer (Holocene HG) (2,4,13,20,23), Neolithic (2,4,12,13,24), Late Neolithic/Chalcolithic/Copper Age (LN/Chalc./CA) (13,25), and Bronze Age (13). Ancient samples are abbreviated consistently using the nomenclature \u201csite-country code-culture\u201d; seeSI Appendix, Table S14andDataset S1for more information. A 3D PCA plot can be viewed as a 3D figure (https://figshare.com/articles/Hofmanova_et_al_3D_figure_S4/3188767).",
            "To examine this clustering of Early Neolithic farmers in more detail, we calculated outgroupf3 statistics (26) of the formf3 (\u2021Khomani; TEST, Greek/Anatolian), where TEST is one of the available ancient European genomes (SI Appendix,SI7. Using f-statistics to Infer Genetic Relatedness and Admixture Amongst Ancient andContemporary Populationsand Figs. S8\u2013S10;Dataset S2); \u2021Khomani San were selected as an outgroup as they are considered to be the most genetically diverged extant human population. Consistent with their PCA clustering, the northern Aegean genomes share high levels of genetic drift with each other and with all other previously characterized European Neolithic genomes, including early Neolithic from northern Spain, Hungary, and central Europe. Given the archaeological context of the different samples, the most parsimonious explanation for this shared drift is migration of early European farmers from the northern Aegean into and across Europe (12).",
            "To better characterize this inferred migration, we modeled ancient and modern genomes as mixtures of DNA from other ancient and/or modern genomes, a flexible approach that characterizes the amount of ancestry sharing among multiple groups simultaneously (18,27) (Fig. 3;SI Appendix,SI10. Comparing Allele Frequency Patterns Among Samples Using a Mixture Model). Briefly, we first represented each ancient or modern \u201ctarget\u201d group by the (weighted) number of alleles that they share in common with individuals from a fixed set of sampled populations (i.e., the \u201cunlinked\u201d approach described in ref.27), which we refer to as the \u201callele-matching profile\u201d for that target group. To cope with issues such as unequal sample sizes, we then used a linear model (28) to fit the allele-matching profile of the target group as a mixture of that of other sampled groups. Sampled groups that contribute most to this mixture indicate a high degree of shared ancestry with the target group relative to other groups. Under this framework the oldest Anatolian genome (Bar31) was inferred to contribute the highest amount of genetic ancestry (39\u201353%) to the Early Neolithic genomes from Hungary (13) and Germany (2) compared with any other ancient or modern samples, with the next highest contributors being other ancient Aegean genomes (Klei10, Pal7, Bar8) (SI Appendix, Figs. S23, S24, and S29). This pattern is not symmetric in that we infer smaller contributions from the German (<26%) and Hungarian (<43%) Neolithic genomes to any of the Anatolian or Greek ancient genomes. Furthermore, in this analysis modern samples from Europe and surrounding regions are inferred to be relatively more genetically related to the Aegean Neolithic genomes than to the Neolithic genomes from Germany and Hungary (Fig. 3;SI Appendix,SI10. Comparing Allele Frequency Patterns Among Samples Using a Mixture Model). These patterns are indicative of founder effects (29) in the German and possibly Hungarian Neolithic samples from a source that appears to be most genetically similar to the Aegean Neolithic samples (specifically, Bar31) and that distinguishes them from the ancestors of modern groups. Consistent with this, we found fewer short runs of homozygosity (ROH) (between 1 and 2 Mb) in our high-coverage Anatolian sample (Bar8) than in Early Neolithic genomes from Germany and Hungary (SI Appendix,SI11. Runs of Homozygosityand Fig. S31). However, it is not possible to infer a direction for dispersal within the Aegean with statistical confidence because both the Greek and Anatolian genomes copy from each other to a similar extent. We therefore see the origins of European farmers equally well represented by Early Neolithic Greek and northwestern Anatolian genomes.",

            "Ongoing gene flow into and across the Aegean is also indicated in the genome of a Chalcolithic individual from Kumtepe [Kum6 (25)], a site geographically close to Barc\u0131n but dating to \u223c1,600 y later. Although archaeological evidence indicates a cultural break in many Aegean and West Anatolian settlements around 5,700/5,600 cal BCE [i.e., spanning this 1,600-y period (30)], Kum6 shows affinities to the Barc\u0131n genomes in \u201coutgroup\u201df3-statistics in the formf3(\u2021Khomani; TEST, Greek/Anatolian). The shared drift between Kum6 and both the early and late Neolithic Aegeans is similar in extent to the drift that Aegeans share with one another. However,f4statistics of the formf4(Aegean, Kum6, Early farmer, \u2021Khomani) were often significantly positive (SI Appendix, Table S22;Dataset S2), suggesting that European Neolithic farmers [namely, Linearbandkeramik (LBK), Starcevo, and Early Hungarian Neolithic farmers] share some ancestry with early Neolithic Aegeans that is absent in Kum6. This is consistent with population structure in the Early Neolithic Aegean or with Kum6 being sampled from a population that differentiated from early Neolithic Aegeans after they expanded into the rest of Europe. Accordingly, compared with Barc\u0131n, Kum6 shares unique drift with the Late Neolithic genomes from Greece (Klei10 and Pal7), consistent with ongoing gene flow across the Aegean during the fifth millennium and with archaeological evidence demonstrating similarities in Kumtepe ceramic types with the Greek Late Neolithic (31). Finally, the Kum6, Klei10, and Pal7 genomes show signals of Caucasus hunter-gatherer (20) admixture that is absent in the Barc\u0131n genomes, suggesting post early Neolithic gene flow into the Aegean from the east.",
            "It is widely believed that farming spread into Europe along both Mediterranean and central European routes, but the extent to which this process involved multiple dispersals from the Aegean has long been a matter of debate (32). We calculatedf4statistics to examine whether the Aegean Neolithic farmers shared drift with genomes from the Spanish Epicardial site Els Trocs in the Pyrenees (3,12) that is distinct from that shared with Early Neolithic genomes from Germany and Hungary. In a test of the formf4(Germany/Hungary EN, Spain EN, Aegean, \u2021Khomani), we infer significant unique drift among Neolithic Aegeans (not significantly in Bar8) and Early Neolithic Spain to the exclusion of Hungarian and German Neolithic genomes (SI Appendix, Table S21). The best explanation for this observation is that migration to southwestern Europe started in the Aegean but was independent from the movement to Germany via Hungary. This is also supported by other genetic inferences (24) and archaeological evidence (33). An alternative scenario is a very rapid colonization along a single route with subsequent gene flow back to Greece from Spain. Potentially, preexisting hunter-gatherer networks along the western Mediterranean could have produced a similar pattern, but this is not supported by archaeological data. Interestingly, \u00d6tzi the Tyrolean Iceman (11) shows unique shared drift with Aegeans to the exclusion of Hungarian Early Neolithic farmers and Late and Post Neolithic European genomes and feasibly represents a relict of Early Neolithic Aegeans (SI Appendix,SI7. Using f-statistics to Infer Genetic Relatedness and Admixture Amongst Ancient and Contemporary Populationsand Table S18).",
            "Given that the Aegean is the likely origin of European Neolithic farmers, we used Bar8 and Bar31 as putative sources to assess the extent of hunter-gatherer admixture in European farmers through the Neolithic.f4statistics of the formf4(Neolithic farmer, Anatolian, HG, \u2021Khomani) indicated small but significant amounts of hunter-gatherer admixture into both Spanish and Hungarian early farmer genomes, and interestingly, the Early Neolithic Greek genome. Our mixture modeling analysis also inferred a small genetic contribution from the Loschbour hunter-gatherer genome (3\u20139%) to each of the Early Neolithic Hungarian and German genomes, but evidence of a smaller contribution to any Aegean genomes (0\u20136%). These results suggest that mixing between migrating farmers and local hunter-gatherers occurred sporadically at low levels throughout the continent even in the earliest stages of the Neolithic. However, consistent with previous findings (3), bothf4statistics and ADMIXTURE analysis indicate a substantial increase in hunter-gatherer ancestry transitioning into the Middle Neolithic across Europe, whereas Late Neolithic farmers also demonstrate a considerable input of ancestry from steppe populations (SI Appendix,SI8. Proportions of Ancestral Clusters in Neolithic Populations of Europeand Fig. S32).",
            "Most of the modern Anatolian and Aegean populations do not appear to be the direct descendants of Neolithic peoples from the same region. Indeed, our mixture model comparison of the Aegean genomes to >200 modern groups (2) indicates low affinity between the two Anatolian Neolithic genomes and six of eight modern Turkish samples; the other two were sampled near the Aegean Sea at a location close to the site of the Neolithic genomes. Furthermore, when we form each Anatolian Neolithic genome as a mixture of all modern groups, we infer no contributions from groups in southeastern Anatolia and the Levant, where the earliest Neolithic sites are found (SI Appendix, Figs. S22 and S30 and Table S30;Dataset S3). Similarly, comparison of allele sharing between ancient and modern genomes to those expected under population continuity indicates Neolithic-to-modern discontinuity in Greece and western Anatolia, unless ancestral populations were unrealistically small (SI Appendix,SI9. Population Continuity). Instead, our mixing analysis shows that each Aegean Neolithic genome closely corresponds to modern Mediterraneans (>68% contributions from southern Europe) and in particular to Sardinians (>25%), as also seen in the PCA and outgroupf3statistics with few substantial contributions from elsewhere. Modern groups matching the Neolithics\u2014mostly from the Mediterranean and North Africa\u2014strikingly match more to Bar8 from northwestern Anatolia than to the LBK genome from Stuttgart in Germany, indicating that the LBK genome experienced processes such as drift and admixture that were independent from the Mediterranean expansion route, consistent with the dual expansion model.",
            "Over the past 7 years, ancient DNA studies have transformed our understanding of the European Neolithic transition (1\u20134,12,13), demonstrating a crucial role for migration in central and southwestern Europe. Our results further advance this transformative understanding by extending the unbroken trail of ancestry and migration all of the way back to southwestern Asia.",
            "The high levels of shared drift between Aegean and all available Early Neolithic genomes in Europe, together with the inferred unique drift between Neolithic Aegeans and Early Neolithic genomes from Northern Spain to the exclusion of Early Neolithic genomes from central Europe, indicate that Aegean Neolithic populations can be considered the root for all early European farmers and that at least two independent colonization routes were followed.",
            "A key remaining question is whether this unbroken trail of ancestry and migration extends all the way back to southeastern Anatolia and the Fertile Crescent, where the earliest Neolithic sites in the world are found. Regardless of whether the Aegean early farmers ultimately descended from western or central Anatolian, or even Levantine hunter-gatherers, the differences between the ancient genomes presented here and those from the Caucasus (20) indicate that there was considerable structuring of forager populations in southwestern Asia before the transition to farming. The dissimilarity and lack of continuity of the Early Neolithic Aegean genomes to most modern Turkish and Levantine populations, in contrast to those of early central and southwestern European farmers and modern Mediterraneans, is best explained by subsequent gene flow into Anatolia from still unknown sources.",
            "Five Neolithic and two Mesolithic samples from both sides of the Aegean were selected for ancient DNA extraction and sequencing (Table 1). DNA was extracted, and Next Generation Sequencing libraries were constructed in dedicated ancient DNA facilities as previously described (1,34) with slight modifications. DNA quality and quantity of all samples were derived from the combination of estimates of endogenous DNA content based on the percentage of reads mapping to the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) after shallow Illumina Miseq sequencing and estimating the DNA copy number of extracts by quantitative PCR. The five Neolithic samples (Bar8, Bar31, Rev5, Klei10, and Pal7) showed endogenous DNA contents between 8.80 and 60.83% and underwent deep Illumina whole-genome resequencing. The two Mesolithic samples (Theo 1 and Theo 5) showed endogenous DNA content of only 0.05% and 0.62%, respectively, and were used to capture the full mitochondrial genome.SI Appendix, Fig. S1, displays the relationship between endogenous DNA content and copy number for each sample and DNA extraction. The enrichment of the mitochondrial genome was carried out with Agilent\u2019s SureSelectXTin-solution target enrichment kit. The protocol for the preparation of further libraries for shotgun sequencing and capture was modified according to previously estimated sample quality, whereby some libraries from samples Bar8, Bar31, and Rev5 were prepared with USER treated DNA extract.

            "To compose a target group as mixtures of other sampled groups, we used the following two-step procedure. First, we used a previously described technique (27) to infer an allele-matching profile for each target group by comparing its allele frequencies independently at each SNP to that of a set of \u201cdonor\u201d groups. In particular, at a given SNP for each chromosome in our target group, we identified all X nonmissing donor chromosomes that shared the same allele type as the target and assigned each of these donors a score of 1/X and all other donors a score of 0. We did this for each SNP and each target individual and then summed up these scores across SNPs and target individuals to give an allele-matching profile for the target group conditional on that set of donors. For each target group, the contributions from each donor group were rescaled to sum to 1. For analyses presented here, our donor groups consisted of modern individuals (2) (plus Neanderthal and Denisova). Our target groups included all modern and ancient groups. Next, analogous to ref.18, we performed a multiple linear regression using the target group\u2019s allele-matching profile as a response and a set of allele-matching profiles of different \u201csurrogate\u201d groups as predictors. In all analyses, we used three different sets of surrogate groups: (i) all (or a subset of) modern groups, (ii) all ancient groups and all (or a subset of) modern groups, and (iii) the modern Yoruba plus all (or a subset of) ancient groups. Mixture coefficients were inferred using nonnegative least squares in R with a slight modification to ensure that the coefficients sum to 1 (SI Appendix,SI10.

We examine the proportion of allele sharing between the ancient haploid and modern diploid genome calls that fall into each of the following six classes: A/AA; D/DD; A/DD; D/AA; A/AD; D/AD (where A = ancestral and D = derived alleles in the ancient haploid/modern diploid genomes, respectively). To generate expected proportions of these allele-sharing classes, we forward-simulate genetic drift by binomial sampling from a set of allele frequency vectors based on the modern site frequency spectrum. Finally, we use Fisher\u2019s method to combine two-tailedPvalues for the observed sharing class fractions falling into the simulated ranges and compare the resultant \u03c72values to those obtained by comparing each simulation against the set of all other simulations (46) to obtain aPvalue.

            "Mitochondrial genomes reveal an east to west cline of steppe ancestry in Corded Ware populations",
            "ABSTRACT",
            "From around 4,000 to 2,000 BC the forest-steppe north-western Pontic region was occupied by people who shared a nomadic lifestyle, pastoral economy and barrow burial rituals. It has been shown that these groups, especially those associated with the Yamnaya culture, played an important role in shaping the gene pool of Bronze Age Europeans, which extends into present-day patterns of genetic variation in Europe. Although the genetic impact of these migrations from the forest-steppe Pontic region into central Europe have previously been addressed in several studies, the contribution of mitochondrial lineages to the people associated with the Corded Ware culture in the eastern part of the North European Plain remains contentious. In this study, we present mitochondrial genomes from 23 Late Eneolithic and Bronze Age individuals, including representatives of the north-western Pontic region and the Corded Ware culture from the eastern part of the North European Plain. We identified, for the first time in ancient populations, the rare mitochondrial haplogroup X4 in two Bronze Age Catacomb culture-associated individuals. Genetic similarity analyses show close maternal genetic affinities between populations associated with both eastern and Baltic Corded Ware culture, and the Yamnaya horizon, in contrast to larger genetic differentiation between populations associated with western Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya horizon. This indicates that females with steppe ancestry contributed to the formation of populations associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture while more local people, likely of Neolithic farmer ancestry, contributed to the formation of populations associated with western Corded Ware culture.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "The forest-steppe north-western Pontic region of the middle Dniester and Prut interfluve was a place of contact and exchange routes between human populations inhabiting the drainages of the Black and Baltic Seas from around 4,000 to 2,000 BC. During this time, the region was occupied by forest-steppe populations attributed to the Eneolithic (3350\u20133200 BC) and the succeeding Bronze Age groups associated with the Yamnaya - Pit Grave (dated to 3,100/3,050\u20132,800 BC), the Catacomb (2,600\u20132,200 BC), the Babyno (2,200\u20131,700/1,600 BC) and the Noua (1,600\u20131,200/1,100 BC) cultures. Although there were cultural differences between these populations, they all shared a similar nomadic lifestyle, pastoral economy and barrow burial rituals. Some of the rounded burial mounds founded by Eneolithic people were reused by the succeeding cultural entities of the Early Bronze Age, while other kurgans shared a mix of characteristics from both the Late Eneolithic and the Early Bronze Age funeral rites.",
            "According to some researchers, the Yamnaya culture originated in the Volga-Ural interfluve and spread across the Pontic-Caspian steppe between 3,300\u20132,800 BC. This cultural expansion led to the development of a less homogenous group of cultural entities belonging to the so-called Yamnaya Cultural-Historical Area/Unity, hereafter reffered to as \u2018the Yamnaya horizon\u2019. People associated with the eastern Yamnaya culture spread across the steppe to the east of Don River. With no settlements identified in this area, they were thought to be more mobile because of their supposed nomadic profile of economy stimulated by environmental conditions of Kuban \u2013 North Caspian steppes. On the other hand, Yamnaya settlements were found more frequently in the forest-steppe Pontic regions, to the west of Don River, probably due to favorable environmental conditions.",
            "One of the most widely debated issues, which emerged in connection to studies on the Yamnaya horizon, was the relationship between the people associated with the Yamnaya and the Central European final Neolithic cultures, in particular the Corded Ware culture (dated to 2800\u20132300 BC). Archaeological records point to some similarities between the Corded Ware culture and the steppe, including shared practices such as the barrow structures and burial rituals. Adoption of a herding economy based on mobility through the use of wagons and horses, was also proposed as a common trait associated with both the Yamnaya and Corded Ware cultures. These observations led some researchers to suggest a possible Yamnaya migration toward the Baltic drainage basin or a massive westward expansion of the steppe pastoralist people, representing the \u201cbarrow culture\u201d, into the North European Plain. However, specific burial customs of the Yamnaya people, such as the scarcity of grave goods, the presence of ochre, and the building of specific wooden roof or floor structures, generated opposing arguments emphasizing the significant differences between the Corded Ware and steppe cultures.",
            "Recent ancient DNA (aDNA) studies suggest that the large-scale migration of steppe populations associated with the Yamnaya horizon contributed to the formation of the final Neolithic central European populations. Moreover, people associated with the Yamnaya horizon have been shown to be an admixed population with ancestry from Eastern hunter-gatherers and Caucasus hunter-gatherers. Ancient DNA data indicate that the Neolithic populations from Central Europe already had the \u2018Caucasus\u2019 genetic component from the eastern steppes around 2,500 BC. Presence of this genetic component was used as an argument for the expansion of people from the Pontic-Caspian region into the central Europe. X chromosome sequence data suggest that it was primarily males who participated in these migrations and contributed to the formation of the people associated with the Corded Ware culture. Based on the X chromosome data obtained mainly from western Corded Ware-associated individuals, it was estimated that, for every female, ~4\u201315 males migrated from the steppe. Subsequently, the Yamnaya genetic component spread across Bronze Age Europe and West Asia.",
            "Although questions concerning the migrations of nomadic people have been addressed by a number of studies, the contribution of mitochondrial lineages associated with the Yamnaya horizon to the formation of people associated with the Corded Ware culture from the eastern part of the North European Plain, especially from the region of modern Poland, remains contentious. To investigate the maternal relationship between these two groups, we generated complete mitochondrial genomes from the representatives of Late Eneolithic and Early Bronze Age populations from the north-western Pontic region, including Yamnaya groups and individuals associated with the Corded Ware culture from the eastern part of the North European Plain.",

Late Eneolithic (N\u2009=\u20095) and Bronze Age human remains (N\u2009=\u200925) originated from western Ukraine and came from the Yampil barrow cemetery complex located in the north\u2013western region of the Black Sea. Bronze Age individuals were associated with different archaeological cultures, including Yamnaya (N\u2009=\u200914), Catacomb (N\u2009=\u20092), Babyno (N\u2009=\u20094) and Noua (N\u2009=\u20095). The sampling localities are shown in Fig.\u00a01. Detailed information about sampled individuals can be found in Table\u00a01, Supplementary Information Text (Materials) and Supplementary Table\u00a0S1.",

            "Ancient DNA was extracted from teeth or petrous bones in a laboratory dedicated to aDNA analyses at the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan (AMU), Poland. Molecular methods used for aDNA extraction and construction of Illumina sequencing genome libraries have been previously described. One extraction and one PCR blank each were set up as negative controls during amplification of the DNA libraries. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 (125\u2009bp, paired-end, each library on 1/10th of a lane) or Illumina HiSeq X Ten (150\u2009bp, paired-end, each library on 1/20th of a lane) at the SNP & SEQ technology platform in Uppsala, Sweden.",
            "Mitochondrial DNA capture enrichment and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing",
            "The RNA bait library for complete mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) enrichment was prepared from two present day individuals of known haplotypes following with minor modifications (see Supplementary Information Text for details). Two rounds of mtDNA enrichment were carried out on 12 libraries that yielded low levels of endogenous mtDNA reads in the initial Illumina shotgun screening (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). Enriched mtDNA Illumina libraries were converted into Ion Torrent sequencing libraries by PCR with indexed fusion primers (Supplementary Table\u00a0S6). PCR-amplified Ion Torrent libraries were purified, prepared into equimolar pools of up to five libraries per pool and sequenced on the Ion 318 chip using the Ion Torrent PGM system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at Molecular Biology Techniques Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, AMU.",
            "Bioinformatics",
            "Preliminary pipeline computation was undertaken using resources provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) through the Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (UPPMAX). Illumina sequencing data were processed using a custom analytical pipeline.",
            "First, we trimmed residual removed adapters and merged read pairs according to. BWA software package version 0.7.8 was used to map merged reads as single-end reads against the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) (GenBank: NC_012920). The ratio of reads mapping to Y and X chromosomes (Ry) (with mapping quality greater than 30) was calculated to assign molecular sex to the individuals sequenced on the Illumina platform.",
            "FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) was used to demultiplex sequences generated by the PGM Ion Torrent. Cutadapt v.1.8.1 was then used to remove long (\u2212M 110), short (\u2212m 35), and low-quality sequences (\u2212q 20). The filtered reads were analyzed with FastQC v 0.11.3 using the options described previously. The sequences were mapped against the rCRS using TMAP v3.4.1. To collapse duplicate sequence reads with identical start and end coordinates (for both PGM and Illumina sequence data) we used FilterUniqueSAMCons.py. Misincorporation patterns were assessed using mapDamage v2.0.5. For each individual, contamination levels were estimated with the use of schmutzi as previously in. Consensus sequences were built using ANGSD v0.910. We accepted only reads with a minimum mapping score of 30, a minimum base quality of 20, and a minimum coverage of 3, as in. Where necessary, comparative published mt genomes were reconstructed from the bam files with the use of the same methods as described above. Mitochondrial haplogroups (mtDNA hgs) were assigned for each individual with the use of HAPLOFIND, the PhyloTree phylogenetic tree build 17 and Mitomaster.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "For comparative studies we used ancient mtDNA data obtained from the literature, the European Nucleotide Archive (www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) and NCBI GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) web databases. All comparative populations used for principal component analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), pairwise genetic distances (FST), and AMOVA analysis are described in detail in Supplementary Tables\u00a0S2\u2013S5. We divided the population associated with the Corded Ware culture into a western group encompassing comparative German samples, and an eastern group comprising individuals linked with the Corded Ware culture from this study. Similarly individuals associated with the Yamnaya horizon were divided into western and eastern groups according to their geographic localization. Due to overlapping dating of the samples and their common origin, the western Yamnaya horizon group encompassed individuals associated with Yamnaya culture and Late Eneolithic from this study, and additional comparative samples from present day Ukraine and Bulgaria. Because of potential maternal kinship between two Catacomb culture-associated individuals from this study, only one of them was used in the PCA and in a comparative Catacomb group. The eastern Yamnaya horizon group consisted of Yamnaya samples from the Samara region in Russia. The map with archaeological sites from which the studied individuals originated, was generated using QGIS 2.12.2 (Fig.\u00a01).",
            "PCA for frequencies of mtDNA hgs was calculated using Python 3.5 and Scikit-learn v. 0.18.1 package. We utilized Matplotlib 1.5.1 Python package for plotting the PCA results and mtDNA hgs loadings.",
            "We have used a centroid-based clustering approach to examine the PCA results and search for logical clusters within our data. We applied the k-means method (as implemented in Scikit-learn v. 0.18.1 Python package) to the first 5 principal components from the PCA analysis (for details see Supplementary Information Text). All k-means variants can be found in the Supplementary Material Text and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S27.",
            "To further explore the relatedness of populations using the mtDNA hg frequencies, we ran the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis as implemented in Scikit-learn (18.1) Python package.",
            "FST values were computed in Arlequin 3.5. In total, 18 populations were used in FST and following AMOVA analyses, consisting only of ancient individuals with complete mtDNA genomes (Supplementary Table\u00a0S3), using Nei\u2019s average number of pairwise differences and 10,000 permutations to estimate the p-values. To visualize FST values we employed multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis with the use of Python Scikit-learn 0.18.1 package.",

Eleven of the mtDNA genomes were retrieved from the Illumina shotgun screening data with the depth-of-coverage (DoC) ranging between ca. 5.4\u00d7 to 64\u00d7. The remaining twelve mtDNA genomes were retrieved from the hybridization capture enrichment followed by PGM Ion Torrent sequencing, and yielded DoC ranging between 11\u00d7 to 194\u00d7. Nucleotide misincorporation patterns assessed using MapDamage showed characteristic aDNA damage involving C-T and G-A transitions at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of DNA fragments, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S26). Schmutzi estimations conducted for each individual showed low levels of contaminations (1\u20133%) (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). Additionally, we found no contamination in the extraction blanks and PCR negative controls. The mitochondrial DNA data are deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MH176332, MH176333, MH17635-MH176355.",
            "In general, the individuals associated with the Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya horizon were assigned to mtDNA lineages common among modern-day west Eurasian groups (hgs H, I, J, T, U2, U4, U5, W, X). Individuals associated with the Eneolithic and Yamnaya cultures were assigned to hgs U2e1a1, U5a2b, H2a1 and U5a1i1, U4c1, W3a1, W3a1a, respectively (Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). Other Bronze Age individuals from the western Pontic region belonged to hg X4 (two individuals associated with Catacomb culture) and J2b1a, J1c2m, H1e (three individuals associated with Babyno culture). Individuals associated with the Corded Ware culture were assigned to hgs H (H6a, H15a1, H2a2, H1e), U4 (U4b1a1a, U4a2f), W5b, U5a1b, I4a and T2e (Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\u00a0S1).",
            "Genetic distances between ancient populations",

Based on these results individuals associated with the western and eastern Yamnaya horizon (YAE and YAW in Fig.\u00a02) were grouped within a cluster consisting of populations from central Eurasia and Europe (blue cluster) including people associated with eastern Corded Ware culture (CWPlM) and Baltic Corded Ware culture (CWBal). This cluster did not contain any populations linked with early Neolithic farmers (red), or hunter-gatherers (green and yellow). On the other hand, k-means clustering linked the western Corded Ware culture-associated population (CWW) with Near East and Neolithic farmer ancestry groups from western and central Europe.",
            "The k-means clustering on t-SNE results was consistent with the PCA results, although the approach to dimension reduction of the t-SNE algorithm is completely different than that of the PCA. Scatterplot of populations colored according to the k-means k\u2009=\u20097 (average silhouette 0.5158) (Fig.\u00a03) represented the main components of European genetic ancestry. Individuals associated with western Corded Ware culture (CWW in Fig.\u00a03) clustered with the early Neolithic Farmer ancestry group (dark green), while people associated with CWPlM from this study and CWBal showed greater affinity to the eastern European cluster (dark blue) which included mostly steppe populations associated with the Yamnaya horizon, Srubnaya, and western Scythians. Another clearly defined cluster was the central-western Asia group (red) with Andronovo, Catacomb and Siberian populations. Iron Age central Asia cluster (light green) consisted mostly of Altai and Russian Scythians and populations from Siberia and Kazakhstan. The strong hunter-gatherer ancestry cluster (light blue) included the hunter-gatherers and Neolithic populations with major hunter-gatherers component associated with the Neolithic Ukraine and the Scandinavian Pitted Ware culture. The last two clusters comprised of populations linked with the post-Linear Pottery culture from central Europe and other Middle and Late Neolithic groups from Europe (yellow and purple).",
            "Pairwise mtDNA-based FST values (Supplementary Table\u00a0S4), visualized on MDS using the raw non-linearized FST (stress value\u2009=\u20090.099) (Fig.\u00a04), also supported the PCA results and indicated that western and eastern Yamnaya horizon groups (YAW and YAE) were closer to people associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture (CWPlM) (FST\u2009=\u20090.00; FST\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively; both p\u2009>\u20090.05) and Baltic Corded Ware culture (CWBal) (FST\u2009=\u20090.00; FST\u2009=\u20090.00, respectively; both p\u2009>\u20090.05), than to populations associated with the western Corded Ware culture (CWW) (FST\u2009=\u20090.047 and FST\u2009=\u20090.059, respectively; both statistically significant p\u2009<\u20090.05). Western and eastern Yamnaya horizon groups also showed close genetic affinity to the Iron Age western Scythians (SCU) (FST\u2009=\u20090.0022 and FST\u2009=\u20090.006, respectively, both p\u2009>\u20090.05). The most distant populations to the Yamnaya horizon groups were western hunter-gatherers (HGW) (FST\u2009=\u20090.23 and FST\u2009=\u20090.15, p\u2009<\u20090.001; see Supplementary Table\u00a0S4).",
            "The FST-based MDS reflected the general European population history in the post-LGM period as the three highest FST scores were detected between western hunter-gatherers (HGW) and people associated with Linear Pottery culture (LBK) (FST\u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009<\u20090.001), between eastern hunter-gatherers (HGE) and Baltic hunter-gatherers (HGBal) (FST\u2009=\u20090.35, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and between western (HGW) and eastern hunter-gatherers (HGE) (FST\u2009=\u20090.36, p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a04 and Supplementary Table\u00a0S4). The Yamnaya horizon groups (YAE and YAW) were placed centrally between northern hunter-gatherers (HGN) and Neolithic farmers (LDN), in direct proximity to the Bronze and Iron Age populations from Eastern Europe (SCU, BARu, SRU) and close to individuals associated with eastern and Baltic Corded Ware culture (Fig.\u00a04).",

Concentrating on the eastern and western Corded Ware groups, we found the best variability distribution when the individuals associated with the western Corded Ware culture (CWW in Supplementary Table\u00a0S5) were grouped together with the Middle Neolithic/Bronze Age Central Europe groups, while individuals associated with the eastern and Baltic Corded Ware culture (CWPlM, CWBal), and Yamnaya horizon groups (YAW and YAE) clustered together with the eastern Europe populations (from the Middle Neolithic-Bronze Age) (4.68% of variability among groups, 3.04% among populations within groups).",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "By analyzing ancient mitochondrial genomes, we show that people from the eastern and western Corded Ware culture were genetically differentiated. Individuals associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture (from present day Poland and the Czech Republic) shared close maternal genetic affinity with individuals associated with the Yamnaya horizon while the genetic differentiation between individuals associated with the western Corded Ware culture (from present-day Germany) and the Yamnaya horizon was more extensive. This decreasing cline of steppe related ancestry from east to west likely reflect the direction of the steppe migration. It also indicates that more people with steppe-related ancestry, likely both females and males, contributed to the formation of the population associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture. Similarly, closer genetic affinity to populations associated with Yamnaya horizon can be observed in Baltic Corded Ware groups, which confirms earlier indications of a direct migrations from the steppe not only to the west but also to the north, into the eastern Baltic region. The mitochondrial data further suggests that with increased distance from the source populations of the steppe, the contribution of local people increase, which is seen as an increase of maternal lineages of Neolithic farmer ancestry in individuals associated with the western Corded Ware culture.",
            "Among the analyzed samples, we identified two Catacomb culture-associated individuals (poz220 and poz221) belonging to hg X4. They are the first ancient individuals assigned to this particular lineage. Haplogroup X4 is rare among present day populations and has been found only in one individual each from Central Europe, Balkans, Anatolia and Armenia. Moreover, we have reported mtDNA haplotypes that might be associated with the migration from the steppe and point to genetic continuity in the north Pontic region from Bronze Age until the Iron Age. These haplotypes were assigned to hgs U5, U4, U2 and W3. MtDNA hgs U5a and U4, identified in this study among Yamnaya, Late Eneolithic and Corded Ware culture-associated individuals, have previously been found in high frequencies among northern and eastern hunter-gatherers. Moreover, they appeared in the north Pontic region in populations associated with Mesolithic (hg U5a), Eneolithic (Post-Stog) (hg U4), Yamnaya (hgs U5, U5a), Catacomb (hgs U5 and U5a) and Iron Age Scythians (hg U5a), suggesting genetic continuity of these particular mtDNA lineages in the Pontic region from, at least, the Bronze Age. Hgs U5a and U4-carrying populations were also present in the eastern steppe, along with individuals from the Yamnaya culture from Samara region, the Srubnaya and the Andronovo from Russia. Interestingly, hg U4c1 found in the Yamnaya individual (poz224) has so-far been found only in two Bell Beaker- associated individuals and one Late Bronze Age individual from Armenia, which might suggest a steppe origin for hg U4c1. A steppe origin can possibly also be assigned to hg U4a2f, found in one individual (poz282) but not reported in any other ancient populations to date, and to U5a1- the ancestral lineage of U5a1b, reported for individual poz232, which was identified not only in Corded Ware culture-associated population from central and eastern Europe but also in representatives of Catacomb culture from the north Pontic region, Yamnaya from Bulgaria and Russia, Srubnaya and Andronovo-associated groups. Hg U2e, reported for Late Eneolithic individual (poz090), was also identified in western Corded Ware culture-associated individual and in succeeding Sintashta, Potapovka and Andronovo groups, suggesting possible genetic continuity of U2e1 in the western part of the north Pontic region.",
            "Hgs W3a1 and W3a1a, found in two Yamnaya individuals from this study (poz208 and poz222), were also identified in Yamnaya-associated individuals from the Russia Samara region and later in \u00dan\u011btice and Bell Beaker groups from Germany, supporting the idea of an eastern European steppe origin of these haplotypes and their contribution to the Yamnaya migration toward the central Europe. The W3a1 lineage was not identified in Neolithic times and, thus, we assume that it appeared in the steppe region for the first time during the Bronze Age. Notably, hgs W1 and W5, which predate the Bronze Age in Europe, were found only in individuals associated with the early Neolithic farmers from Star\u010devo in Hungary (hg W5), early Neolithic farmers from Anatolia (hg W1-T119C), and from the Sch\u00f6ningen group (hg W1c) and Globular Amphora culture from Poland (hg W5).",
            "This study is the first to present mitochondrial genome data from the population associated with Corded Ware culture from the south-eastern part of present-day Poland. As this area is geographically close to the steppe region, it provides us with a better picture of the early steppe migration between 3,000 and 2,500 BC. Although our results indicate a contribution of females as well as males to the formation of populations associated with eastern Corded Ware culture, more detailed studies of X chromosome data are needed to clearly resolve female and male migrations, especially between the western Pontic steppe and the eastern part of the North European Plain.",

            "Conclusions",
            "Ancient mitochondrial genome data from the western Pontic region and, for the first time, from the south-eastern part of present day Poland, show close genetic affinities between populations associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya horizon. This indicates that females had also participated in the migration from the steppe. Furthermore, greater mtDNA differentiation between populations associated with the western Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya horizon points to an increased contribution of individuals with a maternal Neolithic farmer ancestry with increasing geographic distance from the steppe region, forming the population associated with the western Corded Ware culture. Among the analyzed samples, we identified, for the first time in ancient populations, two Catacomb culture-associated individuals belonging to the now-rare mtDNA hg X4.",

            "Diverse origin of mitochondrial lineages in Iron Age Black Sea Scythians",
            "ABSTRACT",
            "Scythians were nomadic and semi-nomadic people that ruled the Eurasian steppe during much of the first millennium BCE. While having been extensively studied by archaeology, very little is known about their genetic identity. To fill this gap, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Scythians of the North Pontic Region (NPR) and successfully retrieved 19 whole mtDNA genomes. We have identified three potential mtDNA lineage ancestries of the NPR Scythians tracing back to hunter-gatherer and nomadic populations of east and west Eurasia as well as the Neolithic farming expansion into Europe. One third of all mt lineages in our dataset belonged to subdivisions of mt haplogroup U5. A comparison of NPR Scythian mtDNA linages with other contemporaneous Scythian groups, the Saka and the Pazyryks, reveals a common mtDNA package comprised of haplogroups H/H5, U5a, A, D/D4, and F1/F2. Of these, west Eurasian lineages show a downward cline in the west-east direction while east Eurasian haplogroups display the opposite trajectory. An overall similarity in mtDNA lineages of the NPR Scythians was found with the late Bronze Age Srubnaya population of the Northern Black Sea region which supports the archaeological hypothesis suggesting Srubnaya people as ancestors of the NPR Scythians.",
            "INTRO",
            "The Eurasian Steppe is a vast grassland region that stretches from the Carpathian foothills to Outer Mongolia. For millennia, the steppe was home to human populations that had a significant and long-lasting impact on the cultural history of the Eurasian continent. One such group that emerged at the beginning of the Iron Age had developed into an ethno-cultural agglomerate commonly referred to as the Scythians. The Scythians are best known from ancient Persian, Greek and Assyrian literary sources mainly for their nomadic warrior lifestyle, but they are also known to have actively practiced farming, pastoralism and may have been among the earliest peoples to master the art of horseback riding.",
            "The territory occupied by contemporaneous nomadic and semi-nomadic Scythian groups with shared elements of material culture extended between the lower stretches of the Danube River in the west and the Yenisei River in the east (Fig. 1). Most archaeology and history researchers suggest that the core territory of the tribes designated as \u201cScythians\u201d in historic literature of Antiquity covered the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the northern Black Sea (the North Pontic region, NPR) between the lower Danube and Don rivers. Together with other contemporaneous groups they formed the \u2018Scythian horizon\u2019. These groups are collectively referred to by some researchers as Scytho-Siberians, who inhabited the steppe regions to the east of NPR Scythians and included Saka from Kazakhstan (7th\u20133rd century BCE) and Pazyryks (5th\u20133rd century BCE) from the Sayano-Altai region of Siberia. The forest-steppe zone of the core Scythian territory in the NPR was settled by populations with agro-pastoral economy, while the nomadic and semi-nomadic Scythian tribes occupied the steppe regions adjacent to the northern Black Sea. Archaeological studies of the Scythian and pre-Scythian period sites in the forest-steppe zone of the NPR pointed towards autochthonous origins of local agro-pastoral Scythian populations. Those groups which first emerged between the middle 7th\u20133rd century BCE, may have been formed on the foundation of pre-existing groups belonging to such cultures as Srubnaya (Timber Grave) and Thracian Hallstatt. The origins of nomadic Scythians in the steppes of Central Asia were supported by recent archaeological findings of elements of developed Scythian material culture in a series of kurgans in the western Sayan Mountains in southern Siberia dated to 9th\u20137th century BCE.",
            "The relationships between the groups of the Scythian horizon are not fully understood. Some researchers regard the NPR Scythians and Scytho-Siberians as one society on account of similar animal motifs on the products of their material culture, while others consider them to be different populations each having a distinct origin and geographic specificity yet sharing cultural traditions. Moreover, the ancestral relationships between the NPR Scythians and local predecessor populations in the Ponto-Caspian region are neither fully resolved.",
            "Most of the current knowledge about the genetic relations among the populations belonging to the Scythian cultural horizon is based on studies of non-coding mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments from Scythian remains from the lower Don and southern Ural regions in Russia as well as Pazyryks from Altai and Inner Mongolia. To date, only one complete mt genome of a Scythian individual from Russia has been published. Mitochondrial lineages in the studied populations consist of an overlapping mix of haplogroups of east and west Eurasian descent, which does not clarify their ultimate origins. Here we aim to identify the maternal origin of the NPR Scythians and their genetic affinities to other contemporary Scythian groups through the analyses of complete mtDNA genomes. The investigated human remains were excavated from kurgans, crypts and ground burials in the main area of Scythian distribution, including territories in the lower Dniester, lower and middle Dnieper and Crimea.",
            "METHODS",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "Materials",
            "We extracted ancient DNA (aDNA) from 29 Iron Age Scythian individuals excavated in present-day Moldova (n\u2009=\u200921) and Ukraine (n\u2009=\u20098). Moldavian samples were obtained from the Archaeological Laboratory collection at the Taras Shevchenko University in Tiraspol. Ukrainian Scythians came from the Archeology Archives of the Institute of Archaeology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv and Odessa, and the Department of Culture and Tourism of the Cherkasy Regional State Administration. Detailed information about the ancient individuals can be found in Supplementary Information Text (Materials and Methods) and Supplementary Table S1.",
            "From each Scythian individual from Moldova two teeth were collected and transferred to the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144 (AMU) in Poland. Ukrainian samples consisted of both bone fragments (n\u2009=\u20095) and teeth (n\u2009=\u20093), which were analyzed at the Archaeological Research Laboratory (AFL), Department of Archaeology and Classical Studies, Stockholm University (SU) in Sweden and the Archeogenetics Laboratory at Grand Valley State University (GVSU) in Allendale, Michigan, USA.",
            "DNA extraction, library construction and Illumina sequencing",
            "All procedures leading to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) were performed in the ancient DNA laboratories located at AMU and the AFL. Mitochondrial hypervariable region I (HVRI) and haplogroup-diagnostic coding regions of mtDNA of the Ukrainian samples were analyzed at GVSU using the methods described in the Supplementary Information Text (Materials and Methods). Osteological samples underwent decontamination procedures including NaOCl and UV treatments (Supplementary Information Text (Materials and Methods)), followed by DNA extraction as described by refs and. Illumina-compatible blunt-end libraries were prepared following and screened on Illumina HiSeq 2500 High Output v4 (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009125\u2009bp). For more details, see Supplementary Information Text (Materials and Methods).",
            "Illumina sequencing was performed at the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) in Stockholm, Sweden. Sequence data were merged and mapped to human genome as previously published. All primary pipeline computations were performed on resources provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) through Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (UPPMAX) under projects b2013240 and b2015307.",
            "Mitochondrial DNA capture enrichment and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing",
            "We used commercially biotinylated probes (MYbaits\u00ae) for human mtDNA provided by MYcroarray\u00ae (Ann Arbor, MI, USA; www.mycroarray.com) for mtDNA enrichment by hybridization capture on the Illumina sequencing libraries. The procedure was undertaken on 25 libraries, which did not yield sufficient mtDNA genome coverage (less than 5x), after initial Illumina screening (Supplementary Table S1). We performed two rounds of target enrichment following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol version 2.3.1 (http://www.mycroarray.com/pdf/MYbaits-manual-v2.pdf). More details about mitochondrial genome capture can be found in Supplementary Information Text (Materials and Methods). Enriched and amplified indexed libraries were purified using MinElute spin columns (Qiagen) and quantified on 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Prior to the amplification by emulsion PCR, the indexed libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations and adjusted to a final concentration of 20\u2009pM. Clonal template amplification on Ion Sphere Particles (ISPs) was performed using the Ion Torrent One Touch System II and the Ion One Touch 200 template kit v2 DL with regard to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sequencing of the templated ISPs was conducted with the use of Ion PGM HI\u2212Q Seq kit and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Ion PGM) system (Ion Torrent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at Molecular Biology Techniques Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, AMU.",
            "Bioinformatic analysis",
            "Customizable analytical pipeline was used to process Illumina sequencing data as described in ref.. Read pairs were merged, and adapters were trimmed according to ref.. Merged reads were mapped as single-end reads against the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) (GenBank: NC_012920) with the use of BWA software package version 0.7.8.",
            "We processed sequence data from PGM Ion Torrent using a pipeline adjusted specifically to the Ion Torrent reads. Sequences were demultiplexed by barcodes using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). Long (\u2212M 110), short (\u2212m 35), and low-quality sequences (\u2212q 20) were removed using Cutadapt v.1.8.1. The filtered sequence reads were analyzed with FastQC v 0.11.3, followed by mapping against the rCRS using TMAP v3.4.1. For more details, see Supplementary Information Text (Materials and Methods).",
            "FilterUniqueSAMCons.py was used to collapse clonal reads with identical start and end coordinates, for both PGM and Illumina sequence data as in ref.. Misincorporation patterns were determined with the use of mapDamage v2.0.5. Final sequences were visualized using Biomatters IGV software v2.3.66. ANGSD v0.910 was applied to build consensus sequence accepting only reads with mapping score of 30, a minimum base quality of 20, and a minimum coverage of 3.",
            "Mitochondrial haplotypes were determined for each sample with the use of HAPLOFIND, and the PhyloTree phylogenetic tree build 17. The mutations reported as unexpected or missing were visually inspected in the original binary alignment map (BAM) files in IGV.",
            "The ratio of reads mapping to Y and X chromosomes (Ry) was calculated to determine molecular sex of individuals sequenced on the Illumina platform. Individuals with the Ry ratio\u2009\u2264\u20090.016 were identified as females, while those with RY\u2009\u2265\u20090.077 were determined as males (Supplementary Information Text Table S7). The molecular sex calculation was restricted only to the DNA sequence reads with mapping qualities of at least 30.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "Comparative ancient samples used in the statistical analyses were retrieved from the web depositories (NCBI Nucleotide, European Nucleotide Archive) and literature. Detailed information about comparative samples used in principal component analysis (PCA), pairwise genetic distances (FST) and median network is shown in Supplementary Tables S2\u2013S4.",
            "To calculate PCA we additionally included Asian origin mtDNA haplogroups (A, B, D, F, G, M) and their frequencies to cover suggested Asian influences into Scythian populations (Supplementary Table S2). PCA was computed using RapidMiner Studio 7 (RapidMiner Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and plotted using Matplotlib 1.5.1 Python package.",
            "We have performed top-down clustering analysis in the form of k-means algorithm to explore the unbiased population relations in the PCA based on haplogropup frequencies sample-set. K-means analysis was performed in RapidMiner Studio 7 (RapidMiner Inc., Boston, MA, USA).",
            "Pairwise genetic distances (FST) were applied only to samples with complete ancient mt genomes (Supplementary Table S3). FST values and Nei\u2019s average number of pairwise differences were computed in Arlequin 3.5. We tested the hierarchical partitioning of the genetic variance in different setups by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) as implemented in Arlequin. Populations used in AMOVA were the same as for the FST analysis and the list is provided in Supplementary Table S3. We have tested several configurations of population groupings to evaluate the best matching position of Scythian population from the NPR and its relation to other populations. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of FST values was computed using Python scikit-learn 0.17 package. The maps were created using QGIS 2.12.2.",
            "The median network was calculated and computed for the haplogroup U5 using the Networks 4.614 software (fluxus-engineering.com) with the most common mutations weighted reversely to their frequency.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Results",
            "We successfully retrieved complete mt genomes for 19 out of the 29 Scythian individuals (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Shotgun screening of genomic DNA libraries generated mt genomes for four individuals with the coverage ranging from 6.5x to 70x. For the remaining samples, the mt capture enrichment followed by Ion Torrent sequencing, provided additional 15 complete mt genomes with the depth of coverage from 7x to 103.9x. Mitochondrial DNA genome data were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KX977302-KX977320.",
            "The analysis of damage patterns revealed the presence of damages typical for aDNA, i.e. C-T and G-A transitions accumulated at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S11).",
            "Mitochondrial lineages in the NPR Scythians analyzed in this study appear to consist of a mixture of west and east Eurasian haplogroups. West Eurasian lineages were represented by subdivisions of haplogroup U5 (U5a2a1, U5a1a1, U5a1a2b, U5a2b, U5a1b, U5b2a1a2, six individuals total, 31.6%), H (H and H5b, three individuals total, 15.8%), J (J1c2 and J2b1a6, two individuals, 10.5%), as well as haplogroups N1b1a, W3a and T2b (one individual each, 5.3% each specimen). East Eurasian mt lineages were represented by haplogroups A, D4j2, F1b, M10a1a1a, and H8c (represented by a single individual), in total, comprising 26.3% of our sample set.",
            "The results of the low-resolution mtDNA screening at GVSU were consistent with whole mt capture results from AMU (see Supplementary Table S1). Polymorphism patterns uncovered in the coding and HVRI regions in specimens SCY009 and SCY011 identified their lineages to belong to haplogroups J and A respectively. Specimens SCY006 and SCY010 were assigned to the M* and N* clades respectfully.",
            "To trace genetic affinities between Scythians from present day Moldova and Ukraine (SCU) and other European and Asian ancient populations, their mt haplogroup frequencies were visualized in the space of principle components. The PCA plot of the first two components accounted for 43.4% of the total variance (Fig. 2). The SCU group was located in direct proximity to the central European Neolithic Corded Ware culture (CWC). It also grouped near a number of Bronze Age populations from eastern and central Europe (Srubnaya (SRU), Yamnaya (YAM) and Unetice (UNC)), as well as from central Asia (Bronze Age Kazakhstan (BAK)). Finally, k-means clustering (k value\u2009=\u20095), grouped SCU within a cluster further encompassing Scythians from Russia (SCR) and Tagar culture from southern Siberia (TAG). The Pazyryks from Mongolia (SCM) and Altai (SCA) were separated from SCU and grouped within the k-mean cluster consisting of Central and East Asian populations.",
            "Slatkin\u2019s linearized pairwise FST values calculated on complete mt genomes and visualized using MDS (Fig. 3) and heatmap (Fig. 4) indicate that the studied Scythian samples are closest to the Srubnaya (SRU) (FST\u2009=\u20090.00; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and Yamnaya (YAM) (FST\u2009=\u20090.006; p\u2009<\u20090.05) populations (see Supplementary Table S5), followed by Unetice (UNC) (FST\u2009=\u20090.008; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and Corded Ware Culture (CWC) (FST\u2009=\u20090.023; p\u2009<\u20090.05). The European Neolithic Linear Ware culture (LBK) (FST\u2009=\u20090.043; p\u2009>\u20090.05) and Near Eastern Neolithic populations (NEN) (FST\u2009=\u20090.062; p\u2009>\u20090.05) appeared most distant to the individuals in our dataset. Correspondingly, in the resulted FST based MDS plot (stress value of 0.012), our Scythian group positioned proximately to Srubnaya (SRU), Yamnaya (YAM) and Unetice (UNC) populations and distantly to Near Eastern and European Neolithic (NEN, LBK) and Near Eastern hunter-gatherer (HGNE) populations (Fig. 3).",
            "Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) summarized and tested the distribution of genetic variability within and between subpopulations. We tested several other combinations of grouping Scythians with two or more populations. The results suggested the combination with the highest intragroup and lowest intergroup genetic variability to be the Scythians-Srubnaya sample-set (4.93% of variability among groups, \u22120.73% among populations within groups). Second best result was observed in combination of Scythians with Unetice sample-set (3.05% among groups, 1.14% among populations). The AMOVA results are summarized in Supplementary Table S6.",
            "Considering the high number of Scythian individuals identified as belonging to haplogroup U5 (31.6%), we conducted median network analysis of published ancient haplotypes belonging to U5a and U5b subdivisions and ranging from the Mesolithic (excluding hunter-gatherers predating last glacial maximum) to the Iron Age (Fig. 5). Haplotypes used in the median network analysis are described in detail in Supplementary Table S4. The Scythians in the U5a cluster were located centrally in the median network, near the U5a ancestral node. The U5a Scythian samples (SCU) grouped together with Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Sweden (haplotypes 3, 4 and 5), Germany (8), Russia (10) and France (45 and 46). Non-Mesolithic samples in those clusters were less numerous and included Srubnaya (SRU) (57) and Yamnaya (YAM) (13 and 14) from Samara region and one representative of Karasuk culture from the Altai territory (central-south Siberia) (24). A single U5b Scythian individual (31) was distant from the East European populations and was placed basally to a broader cluster composed of west hunter-gatherers (HGW) from France (41) and Germany (47) as well as chronologically younger samples from the Middle Neolithic (MNE) and Unetice (UNC) (both from Germany) (15 and 53, respectively).",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "On the basis of published data concerning the phylogeography of mt lineages distribution in ancient populations of Europe and Asia, the 19 complete mt genomes of the NPR Iron Age Scythians produced in this study fall into three main groups of different ancestry. The first group of mt lineages is represented by U5 haplotypes that are considered to be a European Hunter-Gatherer genetic component. The second group comprises haplotypes belonging to H, J, T, W and N1b, ultimately connected to the genetic package of the early Neolithic farmers, and the third group includes A, D, M10 and F mt lineages considered to be of East Eurasian origin.",
            "Representatives of the U5 haplogroup account for one third of the mt haplotypes identified in analyzed Scythians. These ultimately relate to West Eurasian hunter-gatherers, whose descendants extended throughout the European subcontinent and into East Eurasia from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age. We have combined the known diversity of the prehistoric U5 lineage from different sources into a median network, which allowed for identification of candidate source populations contributing to the U5a diversity in NPR Scythians. Although the network approach is still limited by the small number of available samples, our results indicate that the source populations with the most closely related haplotypes are the Bronze Age Srubnaya (SRU) (1900-1200 BCE) and the earlier Yamnaya (YAM) (3300-2700 BCE) from the Ponto-Caspian region and Bronze Age populations from the Altai Mountains, such as Karasuk (1500-800 BCE). Diverse U5a-carrying populations of the steppe such as Yamnaya, Srubnaya and Scythians shared the nomadic lifestyle, with the economic foundations transforming from wild game exploitation in the Mesolithic to pastoralic animal husbandry in the Bronze Age. Furthermore, both Yamnaya and Srubnaya were part of the Kurgan culture phenomenon with the Scythian cultural horizon being the most representative for the kurgan building tradition.",
            "The second group of identified mt genomes in the NPR Scythians is comprised of lineages that suggest associations of the NPR Scythians with the Neolithic European farming groups. Although the mt lineage composition of analyzed Scythians significantly differs from that seen in NEN and LBK groups (FST\u2009=\u20090.06, FST\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively, p\u2009>\u20090.05), particular lineages such as J1c2, T2b, H/H5, H, W and N1b1a ultimately go back to the earliest European farmers. Lineages of J1c, H5 and T2b belong to the Neolithic farming package of mtDNA haplogroups which have been found in most Neolithic and Bronze Age European populations. Noteworthy, individuals belonging to the N1b1a have been found in the Neolithic Anatolia, but the lineage has not appeared in any other Eurasian Neolithic, Bronze or Iron Age populations to date. Therefore, the presence of N1b1a in Scythians could be attributed to population migrations along the southern boundaries of the Ponto-Caspian region.",
            "Mitochondrial lineages T2b, W3a and J2b1a6 have been identified in representatives of the Bronze Age groups such as Srubnaya (T2b, J2b1a, H5), Sintashta (J2b1a, J1c), Yamnaya (W3a and T2b) and Mezhovskaya (J2b1a) along with East European Eneolithic Trypillian culture (T2b), suggesting genetic continuity of these lineages from at least the Bronze Age or even Neolithic times in NPR region. This is further supported by published data which showed that almost one fifth of the genetic makeup of the Late Bronze Age Srubnaya people of the Ponto-Caspian region is of the Early European Farmer or Anatolian Neolithic ancestry possibly resulting from the admixture of populations related to Early European Farmers and Yamnaya. Thus, if the NPR Scythians are the descendants of populations related to Srubnaya, the origin of the identified farming lineages would likely be within the steppe/forest-steppe region between the NPR and southern Ural. According to previous genomic studies the CWC people are likely to have arisen from Yamnaya background. Thus, genetic affinities of the NPR Scythians to the Yamnaya people might also explain their close genetic similarity to the CWC reflected in PCA and FST results. Close genetic relations of the NPR Scythians and Srubnaya are supported by the FST analyses revealing no significant differences between these two populations (Figs 3 and 4, Supplementary Table S5). AMOVA further corroborated these results showing that the combination of Scythians and Srubnaya results in the lowest genetic variability among populations in a group and the highest variability between groups (Supplementary Table S6). Our results support the archaeological interpretations concerning the origin of the Scythians. One of the versions of this theory suggests that the Srubnaya people have migrated in several waves from the Volga-Ural region to the NPR during the second half of the second millennium BCE where their descendants gave rise to the Scythians around the 7th century BCE.",
            "The third group of lineages identified in the NPR Scythians is derived from East Eurasian ancestry. Since, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of agricultural subsistence in East Eurasian Scythians, these lineages should be considered to be genetic components associated with nomadic populations. Mitochondrial haplogroups such as A, D and F have already been found in samples from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age southern Siberia and the Altai. Notably, haplogroup M10 found among Scythians from Glinoe, is present not only in far East Asia but also in modern populations of the Altai. Among ancient populations, the M10 lineages have been found in Chinese specimens from southern Xinjiang (8th -1st century BCE) and Xiongnu (3rd century BCE). Furthermore, haplogroup M have been identified in Pleistocene individuals from western Europe but it is thought that these lineages disappeared due to bottleneck effect in the Last Glacial Maximum. Haplogroup H8c, identified in the NPR Scythians likely belongs to East Eurasian lineages as well. Sequence analysis of 830 modern Eurasian mt genomes suggested a distinct phylogeographc history for H8, with a clustering of Near Eastern and Central Asian haplotypes of H8 and a pronounced presence of carriers of H8c in the Altai region. It was further hypothesized that the distribution of this lineage could have been facilitated by nomadic migrations along the NPR coast. Although our PCA analysis showed Altai Pazyryk (SCA) to be distant from the NPR Scythians (SCU) (Fig. 2), it must be emphasized that the presence of haplogroups A and H8c in the analyzed population connects NPR Scythians to the Altai and identifies this region as a possible source of these East Eurasian mt lineages. The only Scythian mt genome from southern Urals published thus far also belonged to an East Eurasian lineage, G2a. The Y chromosomal lineage (R1a1a1b2a2a) reconstructed for this individual was supposedly characteristic for members of the Srubnaya culture which additionally supports our conclusions concerning close genetic links between Scythians and people related to the late Bronze Age Srubnaya.",
            "Previous analyses of mtDNA HVRI sequence data from Scythians inhabiting Rostov-on-Don region in eastern NPR also resulted in the identification of East Eurasian lineages, such as D. Moreover, mt lineage D4j2 identified in the individual SCY006 was shown to have been dominant in the Pazyryk culture from Altai and Inner Mongolia (4th -2nd century BCE). The presence of East Eurasian mt lineages supports those archaeological theories that acknowledge the influence of an East Eurasian element in the formation of the Scythian horizon.",
            "Scythians from Rostov-on-Don as well as Pazyryks from Altai and Inner Mongolia were carriers of mixed east and west Eurasian lineages, with the dominant presence of the latter at 62.5% and 53.3%, respectively. Mitochondrial haplogroup analyses of the NPR Scythians from this study and those from Rostov-on-Don and Pazyryks from Altai and Inner Mongolia, reveal that, for the most part, the same lineages are found in all three groups and are often singularly represented in each group. Noteworthy, comparing the frequencies of east and west Eurasian haplogroups in all three groups of the Scythian horizon, an east-west mtDNA lineage cline is visible, for east Eurasian lineages going west-east is from 26.3% (in present study) through 37.5% (in Scythians from Rostov-on-Don) to 46.7% (in Pazyryks) with the opposite trend for west Eurasian lineages. Otherwise, mt lineage composition is comparable in all three groups of the Scythian horizon which supports their shared maternal genetic roots founded on the common east and west Eurasian substrate with an input from neighboring populations. The genetic influx of East Eurasian haplotypes might be the result of establishing relationships between migrants with European ancestry and women of east Eurasian origin as was previously proposed by in case of Iron Age south Siberian populations. However, more detailed studies of autosomal DNA are needed to clearly resolve this issue.",
            "CONCL",
            "Conclusions",
            "Sequence data from whole mt genomes indicate three potential mtDNA lineage ancestries of the NPR Scythians. The first component traces back to west Eurasian hunter-gatherers and is represented by the lineages belonging to subdivisions of haplogroup U5. The second component is composed of mt lineages connected with Neolithic farming expansion into Europe (H, J, T, W and N1b). The last ancestral mt lineage component is comprised of east Eurasian haplotypes belonging to D, A, F1, H8 and M10 which point to association of the NPR Scythians with east Eurasian populations, in particular from the Altai region. A comparison of NPR Scythian mtDNA lineages with other ancient groups suggests close genetic affinities with representatives of the Bronze Age Srubnaya population, which is in agreement with the archaeological hypothesis suggesting Srubnaya people as the ancestors of the NPR Scythians.

            "Cultural variation impacts paternal and maternal genetic lineages of the Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan groups from Thailand",
            "ABSTRACT",
            "The Hmong-Mien (HM) and Sino-Tibetan (ST) speaking groups are known as hill tribes in Thailand; they were the subject of the first studies to show an impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs. male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation. However, HM and ST groups have not been studied in as much detail as other Thai\u00a0groups; here we report and analyze 234 partial MSY sequences (\u223c2.3\u2009mB) and 416 complete mtDNA sequences from 14 populations that, when combined with our previous published data, provides the largest dataset yet for the hill tribes. We find a striking difference between Hmong and IuMien (Mien-speaking) groups: the Hmong are genetically different from both the IuMien and all other Thai groups, whereas the IuMien are genetically more similar to other linguistic groups than to the Hmong. In general, we find less of an impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mtDNA vs. MSY variation than previous studies. However, there is a dramatic difference in the frequency of MSY and mtDNA lineages of Northeast Asian (NEA) origin vs. Southeast Asian (SEA) origin in HM vs. ST groups: HM groups have high frequencies of NEA MSY lineages but lower frequencies of NEA mtDNA lineages, while ST groups show the opposite. A potential explanation is that the ancestors of Thai HM groups were patrilocal, while the ancestors of Thai ST groups were matrilocal. Overall, these results attest to the impact of cultural practices on patterns of mtDNA vs. MSY variation.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "Thailand occupies the center of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) and shares borders with several countries: Laos and Myanmar in the North and West, Laos in the Northeast, Cambodia in the East, and Malaysia in the South (Fig.\u00a01). With a census size of ~68.61 million in 2018, there are 73 different recognized languages belonging to five different linguistic families: Tai-Kadai (TK, 89.4%), Austroasiatic (AA, 4.0%), Sino-Tibetan (ST, 3.2%), Austronesian (AN, 2.8%), and Hmong-Mien (HM, 0.2%). Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of modern humans in the area of Thailand since the late Pleistocene. More recently, archaeogenetics studies indicate that modern AA-speaking groups in Southeast Asia (SEA) are descended from a dispersal of Neolithic farmers from southern China that occurred ~4000 years ago (kya). Archaeological and linguistic evidence supports the presence of AA people by at least 2.5\u2009kya, while a later expansion of the TK-speaking groups from southern China reached present-day Thailand ~2\u2009kya. And, historical evidence indicates that the homeland of many ST and HM speaking hill tribe groups (e.g., Akha, Lisu, Lahu, Karen, Hmong, and IuMien) is in the area further north of Thailand, i.e., northern Myanmar, northern Laos, and southern China, and most of these groups migrated to present-day Thailand ~200\u2009ya. Thus, the present-day cultural and linguistic variation in Thailand has multiple sources, but the HM and ST groups have not been studied in as much detail and the impact of this variation on genetic variation is still poorly understood.",
            "The HM language family is one of the major language families in MSEA, comprising some 39 languages (35 Hmongic and 4 Mienic) distributed across China, northern Vietnam, northern Laos, and northern Thailand. Although the Hmongic and Mienic languages are relatively similar to one another, there are differences due to divergent developments in the phonology. The heartland of the Hmong people is considered to be in the present-day southern Chinese province of Kweichow, where they were established at least 2\u2009kya, probably arriving from the east. Migrations into Thailand through Laos are documented since the second half of the 19th century A.D. The IuMien are, like the Hmong, thought to have an origin in southeastern China, from which they started to migrate southwards to Vietnam in the 13th century A.D., entering Thailand about 200\u2009ya. With two main ST subfamilies, Chinese and Tibeto-Burman, the ST family is both large (~460 languages spoken by over a billion people) and spread across many countries in South, East and SEA, including China, Nepal, Bhutan, northeastern India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos.",
            "The HM and ST groups in Thailand are regarded as the hill tribes who inhabit the high mountainous northern and western region of Thailand. Consisting of ~700,000 people, there are nine officially recognized hill tribes: the AA-speaking Lawa, Htin and Khmu; the HM-speaking Hmong and IuMien; and the ST-speaking Karen, Lahu (or Mussur), Akha, and Lisu. In addition to living in a remote and isolated region of Thailand, the hill tribes are of interest for their cultural variation. In particular, postmarital residence pattern varies among the hill tribes, with some practicing patrilocality (i.e., following marriage, the woman moves to the residence of the man) while others are matrilocal (i.e., the man moves to the residence of the woman). The first study to document an effect of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of human mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs. male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation was carried out on the hill tribes, and has been further investigated in subsequent studies.",
            "Our previous studies on the paternal and maternal genetic lineages and structure of many TK and AA groups indicated different and complex demographic histories in populations from Thailand and Laos. However, the ST and HM speaking groups have not been studied in as much detail. Here we generated and analyzed 416 complete mtDNA genome sequences and 234 partial sequences of the MSY from 14 populations belonging to 11 HM and ST speaking hill tribe populations, and from three non-hill tribe TK populations: the Shan, who migrated recently from Myanmar and live in the mountainous area of northern Thailand; and the Phutai and Lao Isan from the Northeast of Thailand (Fig.\u00a01). This is the first detailed genetic study of Thai HM speaking groups and we also revisit the impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mtDNA and MSY variation with higher-resolution methods and more populations than studied previously.",
            "METHODS",
            "Materials and methods",
            "Samples",
            "Samples were collected from 416 individuals belonging to 14 populations classified into three linguistic groups: (1) HM groups, consisting of five Hmong populations (HM1\u2013HM5) and two IuMien populations (Y1 and Y2); (2) ST groups, consisting of two Lahu populations (MR and MB), one Lisu (LS), and one Karen subgroup Skaw (KPW3); and (3) Tai-Kadai groups, consisting of one Shan population (SH2), one Phutai population (PT2), and one Lao Isan population (IS5); (Supplementary Table S1; Fig.\u00a01). Genomic DNA samples of HM1\u2013HM4 and Y1 and Y2 were from a previous study, while the remaining groups were newly-collected buccal samples obtained with written informed consent and with ethical approval from Khon Kaen University and the Ethics Commission of the University of Leipzig Medical Faculty. We extracted DNA using the Gentra Puregene Buccal Cell Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.",
            "Sequencing",
            "Genomic libraries with double indices were prepared and enriched for mtDNA as described previously. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 to obtain mtDNA consensus sequences as described in our previous studies. We used Bustard for Illumina standard base calling and the read length was 76\u2009bp. We also enriched for \u223c2.3\u2009mB of the MSY from the same genomic libraries for male samples via in-solution hybridization-capture using a previously designed probe set and the Agilent Sure Select system (Agilent, CA). The target MSY regions are positioned between positions 9927192 and 13199427 on the human reference genome hg19. Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with paired-end reads of 125\u2009bp length and we used Bustard for Illumina standard base calling. The process for manipulating raw sequencing data, alignment and post-processing pipeline of the sequencing data for both mtDNA and MSY were carried out as previously described. We then manually checked and manipulated sequences with Bioedit (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). The complete mtDNA sequence data set can be found at GenBank (accession number MT418943\u2013MT419358). All reads that aligned to the region of the MSY that was targeted by the capture-enrichment array were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (study ID PRJEB36639). Final SNP genotypes and their chromosomal positions on hg19 are provided in Supplementary Table S2.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "The newly-generated 234 MSY sequences from 14 populations were combined with 928 sequences from 59 populations from our previous studies for a total of 1162 sequences belonging to 73 populations. For mtDNA, combining the 416 new sequences from this study with 1434 sequences from our previous studies brings the total to 1850 sequences from 73 populations. Summary statistics of the genetic diversity within populations, the matrix of pairwise genetic distances (\u03a6st), and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were obtained with Arlequin 3.5.1.3. To visualize population relatedness, the R package was used to carry out the nonmetric MDS analysis (based on the \u03a6st distance matrices for the MSY and mtDNA) (R function: isoMDS package: MASS) and to construct heat plots of the \u03a6st distance matrix and the matrix of shared haplotypes (R function: ape, pegas, adegenet and ggplot2 packages). STATISTICA 13.0 (StatSoft, Inc., USA) was used to carry out a correspondence analysis (CA) based on MSY and mtDNA haplogroup frequencies. For the MSY, haplogroup assignment was performed by yHaplo. Haplogroups were assigned to the maximum depth possible given the phylogeny of ISOGG Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree 2015 (http://www.isogg.org/) and the available genetic markers in our target region. The derived SNPs for each sample are provided in Supplementary Table\u00a0S2. The mtDNA haplogroups were assigned by Haplogrep2 with PhyloTree mtDNA tree Build 17 (http://www.phylotree.org) and the polymorphisms for each sample are provided in Supplementary Table\u00a0S3. To obtain a broader picture of population relationships within SEA, we included publicly-available sequences from relevant populations for the MSY and mtDNA (Supplementary Table\u00a0S4). To compare Northeast Asia (NEA) and SEA prevalent haplogroups with our studied populations, we calculated the frequency of MSY/mtDNA NEA and SEA prevalent haplogroups in the HM and ST speaking populations from China and Vietnam (Supplementary Table\u00a0S5). To construct Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) per population and maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees per haplogroup, based on Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses, we used BEAST 1.8.4. For BSP plots by population, we conducted analyses both pooling all populations within the same ethnicity (e.g., pooling HM1-HM5), and for the individual populations. The Bayesian MCMC estimates (BE) and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals of haplogroup coalescent times were calculated using the CongPy6 sequence (haplogroup A1b1-M14) for rooting the tree for MSY haplogroup C and the Mbuti-3 sequence (haplogroup B-M182) for rooting the tree for haplogroups F and O. BEAST input files were created with BEAUTi v1.8.2 after first running jModel test 2.1.7 in order to choose the most suitable model of sequence evolution. The best substitution models are shown in Supplementary Table\u00a0S6. We used an MSY mutation rate of 8.71\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210 substitutions/bp/year, and the BEAST input files were modified by an in-house script to add in the invariant sites found in our data set. Both strict and log normal relaxed clock models were run, with marginal likelihood estimation. After each BEAST run, the Bayes factor was computed from the log marginal likelihood of both models to choose the best-fitting BSP/MCC tree (Supplementary Table\u00a0S6). For mtDNA, we executed BSP analyses per population and the BEAST runs by haplogroup, with mutation rates of 1.708\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128 and 9.883\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128 for data partitioned between the coding and noncoding regions, respectively. The RSRS was used for rooting the tree for mtDNA. The strict clock model was used, and the best substitution models are shown in Supplementary Table\u00a0S6. The Bayesian skyline piecewise linear tree prior for the dating and Bayesian skyline generation were applied, so as to allow for population size changes over time. The number of chains for each MCMC were varied based on sample sizes (Supplementary Table\u00a0S6), but were always sufficient for successful Bayesian estimation and to reach ESS values above 200. Tracer 1.6 was used to generate the BSP plot from the BEAST results. The Bayesian MCC trees were assembled with TreeAnnotator and drawn with FigTree v 1.4.3.",

            "We combined the 234 newly-generated sequences with 928 sequences from our previous studies for a total of 1161sequences, of which 818 are distinct, from 73 populations; population details are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a0S1. The mean coverage of the newly-generated 234 MSY sequences of \u223c2.3\u2009mB ranges from 7\u00d7 to 60\u00d7 (overall average coverage 18\u00d7) (Supplementary Table\u00a0S2).",
            "When combined with our previous Thai/Lao data, there are a total of 90 haplogroups identified (Supplementary Table\u00a0S7); 10 of these were not found in our previous studies. O1b1a1a (O-M95) (26.61%), O2a2b1a1 (O-Page23) (9.75%), and O1b1a1a1a1 (O-M88) (7.15%) are prevalent in almost all groups (overall frequency 43.52%) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1). Haplogroup O2a2a1a2a1a2 (O-N5) and C-F845 are mostly prevalent in HM groups while haplogroup F is the dominant haplogroup of the Lahu (MR and MB). The coalescent ages of these three haplogroups are ~2.45\u2009kya (HPD: 2.88\u20131.13\u2009kya) for O2a2a1a2a1a2 (O-N5), ~12.54\u2009kya (HPD: 17.16\u20134.09\u2009kya) for C-F845 and ~16.00\u2009kya (HPD: 22.59\u201312.26\u2009kya) for haplogroup F. However, if we focus on HM or Lahu clades of the MCC tree of haplogroup C-F845, the age is ~2.85\u2009kya (HPD: 4.25\u20131.08\u2009kya) and ~0.58 ya (HPD: 1.55\u20130.29) for haplogroup F (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2).",
            "When we focus on the MSY lineages that are prevalent in NEA, i.e., C2e*, D-M174 and N* in our samples, the frequency of NEA lineages is >30% among the Hmong (HM2-HM4), Lawa (LW2), and Karen (KPA) from northern Thailand, and the Nyaw (NY) from northeastern Thailand. In contrast O1b*, which is the predominant lineage in SEA and at high frequency in AA speaking people, is the major lineage in the Thai/Lao AA speaking group (except for some Mon populations who show evidence of admixture with Central Thai populations). Interestingly, there is heterogeneity in the frequency of NEA/SEA lineages in the Hmong and Lawa groups: among the five Hmong populations, HM5 completely lacks NEA lineages, while within the Lawa groups, LW2 has 56% NEA lineages while LW3 has exclusively SEA lineages (Fig.\u00a01).",
            "mtDNA",
            "We generated 416 complete mtDNA sequences with mean coverage ranging from 35\u00d7 to 7752\u00d7 (overall average coverage 1934\u00d7) (Supplementary Table\u00a0S3). When combined with 1434 sequences from our previous studies there are in total 1850 sequences belonging to 73 populations, with 1125 haplotypes. When combined with our previous data there are a total of 285 haplogroups (Supplementary Table\u00a0S8); several were not reported previously from Thai/Lao populations and these are specific to some populations, e.g., B4a5 (specific to the Hmong), and B5a1c1a, B5a1c1a1, D4e1a3, and F1g1 (specific to HM groups).",
            "The coalescent ages (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3) of the prevalent lineages of HM groups are ~10.67\u2009kya (HPD: 11.27\u20133.31\u2009kya) for B5a1c1a*, ~1.53\u2009kya (HPD: 3.96\u20130.94\u2009kya) for B5a1c1a1, ~6.83\u2009kya (HPD: 7.09\u20131.55\u2009kya) for D4e1a3, ~11.54\u2009kya (HPD: 16.04\u20135.84\u2009kya) for F1g1. B4a5, specific for the Hmong, has a coalescent age of ~6.63 (HPD: 11.16\u20133.22\u2009kya). The coalescent ages of D4j1a1 and G1c, abundant in the Lahu, are ~9.23\u2009kya (HPD: 12.07\u20134.85\u2009kya) and ~3.88\u2009kya (HPD: 4.70\u20130.21\u2009kya). In addition, the Lahu-specific clade of D4j1a1 sequences is dated to 2.49\u2009kya (HPD: 5.83\u20131.53\u2009kya). The coalescent age of B6a1a, abundant in the Karen, is ~6.69\u2009kya (HPD: 11.62\u20134.25\u2009kya).",

In contrast, the predominant SEA haplogroups (B5*, F1a*, M7b* and R9b*) are at highest frequency in TK and AA speaking groups, indicating genetic similarity between these two groups. Strikingly, the populations with the highest frequencies of NEA MSY lineages are not the same as the populations with the highest frequencies of NEA mtDNA lineages (Fig.\u00a01), which we suggest below may reflect differences in ancestral postmarital residence patterns.",
            "Genetic diversity",
            "MSY",
            "Overall, the HM, AA and ST groups tend to have more heterogeneous and lower genetic diversity values than the TK groups (Fig.\u00a02; Supplementary Table\u00a0S9). By contrast, genetic diversities of the HM groups are not statistically different from the AA and ST groups, nor do the ST and AA groups differ significantly in genetic diversity values (Supplementary Table\u00a0S9). At the individual population level, out of 63 populations, the Hmong (HM1) shows lower haplotype diversity than all other groups except for two hunter-gatherer groups (Mlabri (MA) and Maniq (MN)) and the Htin Mal (TN1). HM1 and HM5 have lower genetic diversity than the other HM populations, although HM2 shows the highest MPD values. Generally, the Hmong (HM1\u2013HM5) groups show lower haplotype and haplogroup diversity than the In Mien (Y1\u2013Y2) (Fig.\u00a02a, b). Of the eight ST speaking populations, the newly-studied Karen group (KSK3) exhibits lower genetic diversities while the Lisu (LS) and KSK1 have higher genetic diversities than the other ST speaking populations (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013d). Although low genetic diversities are observed in HM1, a significantly low Tajima\u2019s D value (Fig.\u00a02d) suggests recent paternal expansion in this group. Significant negative Tajima\u2019s D values were observed more frequently in the TK than in the AA and HM groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05: 11/34 for TK, 6/24 for AA, and 2/7 for HM) but no significant Tajima\u2019s D values were observed in any of the ST-speaking groups\u00a0(Fig. 2d).",
            "mtDNA",
            "Along with the Mlabri (MA), Htin (TN1 and TN2), and Seak (SK), the ST speaking Lahu or Mussur (MR) shows low mtDNA haplotype and haplogroup diversities whereas the Lisu (LS) shows higher genetic diversities than the other ST populations (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c). In contrast to the MSY, the Hmong groups exhibited generally higher genetic diversities than the ST and AA speaking groups (Supplementary Table\u00a0S9). Both the ST and AA groups have lower genetic diversity values than the TK groups (Supplementary Table\u00a0S9). As also seen in the MSY results, both IuMien populations (Y1 and Y2) show higher genetic diversities than the other Hmong and ST speaking groups (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c). In agreement with the MSY results, a significantly negative Tajima\u2019s D value was observed more frequently for the TK than for the AA and HM groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05: 21/34 for TK, 5/24 for AA, and 2/7 for HM). Interestingly, the ST-speaking groups show no significant Tajima\u2019s D values while the two IuMien groups both show significant negative Tajima\u2019s D values (Fig.\u00a02d).",
            "The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)",
            "MSY",
            "The AMOVA results indicate that the variation among populations accounts for 13.72% of the total MSY genetic variance (Table\u00a01). The HM group shows the greatest genetic heterogeneity among populations, followed by the AA and ST groups; the TK group shows the lowest among-population variation. The Thai Hmong, with five populations sampled, shows higher variation among the populations than do the other hill tribe groups. When HM and ST populations from Vietnam were included in the analysis, genetic variation among populations of the ST and HM groups increased substantially, suggesting some differentiation between Vietnamese and Thai populations belonging to these two groups. However, a direct comparison of Thai ST vs. Vietnamese ST, and Thai HM vs. Vietnamese HM groups, showed no significant differences between groups. The variation among populations within groups of the IuMien and Lahu were much lower than for the Hmong, indicating genetic heterogeneity of the Hmong and ST populations and more homogeneity for the IuMien and Lahu. The MSY genetic variation showed significant differences among the four language families (HM, ST, AA, and TK), but the variation among groups was lower than the variation among populations within each group, indicating that language families do not correspond to genetic structure. All pairwise comparisons of the four language families showed significant differences among groups, but these were on the same order as the differences among populations within the same group. However, when the HM were separated into Hmong and IuMien, the pairwise comparisons of Hmong with other language families remained significant, while for the IuMien there were no significant differences with other language families, suggesting some differences between Hmong and IuMien groups. The lowest variation was between the TK and AA groups, indicating a relatively close genetic relationship between these two.",
            "mtDNA",
            "The total mtDNA variation among populations of 8.46% was lower than for the MSY (Table\u00a01). The mtDNA variation for the AA, ST, and TK groups was about the same as for the MSY, but was substantially less for the HM. The Htin have by far the largest variation among populations, while the Hmong show nonsignificant mtDNA variation among populations (0.53%), reflecting genetic homogeneity in their maternal side. The mtDNA genetic variation among the four language families (HM, ST, AA, and TK) was much smaller (1.09%) than the variation among populations assigned to each group (7.7%), indicating that as with the MSY, language families do not correspond to the genetic structure of these populations. The variation between pairs of linguistic groups shows in all comparisons that the variation between groups is lower than the variation among populations within groups. As with the MSY, the lowest variation (which is not significantly different from zero) is between the TK and AA groups, further supporting a close relationship between these two groups in Thailand.",
            "The pooled mtDNA data of Lahu from Vietnam and Thailand revealed much larger variation for mtDNA (13.47%) than for the MSY (4.88%), in contrast to the larger MSY than mtDNA variation observed when pooling data from other groups from Thailand and Vietnam. In particular, the mtDNA variation among Hmong groups from Thailand and Vietnam was only 1.08%, which is not significantly different from zero. When the Hmong and IuMien were separately compared with other linguistic groups, significant differences were observed for the Hmong but not for IuMien, similar to the MSY results and further supporting the difference between Hmong and Mien groups.",
            "Population affinity",
            "MSY",
            "Shared haplotypes within populations are an indication of smaller population size and increase relatedness among individuals, while shared haplotypes between populations are an indication of recent shared ancestry or contact. There were shared MSY haplotypes within the HM groups, and some sharing between them and a few TK-speaking groups, except for HM5 and Y1, who did not share any haplotypes with any other populations (Fig.\u00a03a). The Lisu shared haplotypes with both Lahu (MB and MR) populations, while both Lahu populations shared haplotypes among themselves and also with one group of central Thai (CT5). The newly studied Karen (KSK3) shared haplotypes with the other Karen populations (KSK1, KSK2, and KPW), and also with their neighbors, i.e., Shan (SH2) and Lawa (LW1) (Fig.\u00a03a).",
            "Genetic distance values are a further indication of genetic relationships among populations; the genetic distances (\u03a6st values) indicate, in general, genetic heterogeneity among AA populations and homogeneity among TK populations, as well as genetic differences between the AA (except the Mon) and TK populations. For the newly-studied HM groups, significant genetic differences between the Hmong and almost all other populations were observed, whereas the \u03a6st values for comparisons of the IuMien (Y1 and Y2) and Lisu with many populations were not significant (Fig.\u00a03b). The new Karen group is significantly different from almost all populations except SH2 and KSK1. The two Lahu populations are genetically distinct from all other populations (except each other).",
            "To further visualize the relationships based on the \u03a6st distance matrix, we carried out MDS analysis. The MDS plot for three dimensions indicates genetic distinction of the Maniq (MN), the hunter-gatherer group from southern Thailand, the Hmong groups (HM1-HM5) and the Karen (KSK3) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4), as further indicated in the MDS heat plot (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5). Based on the MDS results for both the MSY and mtDNA, we removed five highly-diverged populations (MA, MN, TN1, TN2, and SK); a three-dimension MDS for the remaining 68 populations has an acceptable stress value (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013c). There was overall some clustering of populations according to language family, albeit with some overlapping between them. The Hmong populations are quite distinct from all other groups, whereas the IuMien populations are more similar to other groups than to the Hmong groups. The TK overlap with AA groups, but the AA are more spread out, indicating more genetic divergence of AA groups. KSK3 and, to a lesser extent, KSK2 and both Lahu populations are distinct from the other ST groups.",
            "To investigate the relationships of Thai/Lao populations with other SEA populations, we included available comparable sequencing data from populations from Vietnam, southern China, and Myanmar. The MDS plot based on the \u03a6st distance matrix of 88 populations (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c; the same outliers are excluded as in Fig.\u00a04a\u2013c) shows clustering of the Vietnamese HM-speaking Pathen and Hmong with the Thai Hmong populations, while the Vietnamese HM-speaking Yao are more similar to the Thai IuMien groups. The Karen (KSK3) remains distinct, but shows a close genetic relatedness to Burmese. Some of the TK-speaking groups from Vietnam, i.e., Nung, Tay and Thai, are close to the TK populations from northeastern Thailand, e.g., Phutai (PT1 and PT2), Kalueang (KL), and Black Tai (BT1).",
            "To investigate which MSY haplogroups might be driving population relationships, we carried out a correspondence analysis (CA), which is based on haplogroup frequencies. The results indicate that the genetic distinctiveness of the Hmong reflects high frequencies of haplogroups O2a2a1a2a1a2 (O-N5) and C2e2 (C-F845) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6). One IuMein population (Y1) is positioned between the Hmong and other Thai/Lao populations, reflecting haplogroups D (D-M174) and C2e1b1 (C-F1319). The second dimension distinguishes the two Lahu groups (MB, MR) and Seak (SK), based on haplogroup F (F-M89). The Soa (SO) occupy an intermediate position, based on O1b1a1a1a2a1a (O-Z24091). The third dimension distinguishes three of the Karen populations (KSK1, KSK2, and KPW), based on haplogroups O1b1a1a1b1a1 (O-FGC29907) and G1 (G-M342). Further dimensions distinguish an AA group (LW2) based on haplogroups O2a2b2a2 (O-F706) and N (N-M231), while the AA group MO2 and TK group CT7 are distinguished based on haplogroups R1a1a1b2a1b (R-Y6) and J2a1 (J-L26).",
            "mtDNA",
            "With respect to mtDNA haplotype sharing (Fig.\u00a03a), the HM populations (HM1\u2013HM5) share mtDNA haplotypes extensively with each other, including with the IuMien populations (Y1 and Y2), but do not share haplotypes with any other population, reflecting their unique genetic structure. As with the MSY results, the Lisu (LS) only shares haplotypes with both Lahu populations (MB and MR), indicating contact between them. The newly studied Karen population (KSK3) also exhibits large differences from the other Karen groups: there is no mtDNA haplotype sharing between the KSK3 and the other Karen populations, while some of the other Karen populations do share haplotypes with one another.",
            "The heat plot of \u03a6st genetic distances (Fig.\u00a03b) also supports genetic distinction of the HM from other Thai/Lao populations, and mostly nonsignificant \u03a6st values among them, with the exception of the IuMien populations and HM3, who show more similarity to other Thai/Lao populations. However, consistent with the MSY results, Lisu are not significantly different from several TK, AA, and ST speaking populations, while the two Lahu populations do not differ significantly from each other, but do show significant differentiation from the other Thai/Lao groups.",
            "The MDS plots based on \u03a6st values for the Thai/Lao populations show greatest genetic divergence for the MA, the hunter-gatherer group from northern Thailand, followed by their linguistic relatives, the Htin (TN1, TN2) and Seak (SK) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4). After removal of the same five outliers as for the MSY analysis (MA, MN, TN1, TN2, and SK), the MDS analysis based on dimensions 1 and 2 shows separation between the Hmong populations and the ST populations, with the IuMien populations rather closer to the cloud of TK populations around the center of the plot. The Karen groups are further differentiated by dimension 3 (Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f).",
            "The MDS plot based on the \u03a6st distance matrix that includes comparative data from other SEA populations (Fig.\u00a05d\u2013f) shows that the HM speaking populations from Thailand and Vietnam tend to cluster together, except the Thai/Vietnamese IuMien are closer to other populations, consistent with the MSY results. The Vietnamese Lahu are quite distinct from the Thai Lahu, and in fact are closer to the Thai HM groups. Interestingly, the ST speaking populations are about as heterogeneous as the AA speaking groups.",
            "The CA analysis based on mtDNA haplogroup frequencies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7) further confirms the distinctiveness of the HM groups based on several haplogroups, i.e., B5a1c1a, B5a1c1a1, B4a5, C7a, D4e1a3, F1g1, F1g2, N9a10 (16311C), and M74a. The Lahu and MO5 were distinguished in the third dimension, reflecting haplogroups B4e and D4j1a1. In the fourth dimension several groups are distinguished via many specific lineages, including all of the Karen groups and two Mon groups from the border between Thailand and Myanmar.",

            "MSY",
            "The BSPs of population size change (Ne) over time were constructed for each ethnicity. For the MSY, different trends were observed for different groups (Fig.\u00a06). The Ne of the Hmong gradually increased since ~30\u2009kya and then declined ~2\u20133\u2009kya, while for the Lahu the Ne remained stable for a long period of time and then was sharply reduced around ~1\u2009kya. The Karen, Shan, and Phutai showed a similar trend: the Ne gradually increased, and then decreased ~5\u2009kya, with sharp increases ~2\u20133\u2009kya, followed by another decrease ~1\u2009kya. The Ne for the IuMien slightly increased, and then decreased ~2\u20133\u2009kya. In general, we see similar demographic changes at 5\u2009kya, 2\u20133\u2009kya and 1\u2009kya in both the new groups studied here and in our previous studies of AA Mon, Khmer and Htin groups, and central Thai TK groups. The first two changes may reflect male-specific expansion during the Neolithic period and the Bronze/Iron Age that are characteristic of modern AA and TK groups respectively, as discussed previously.",
            "mtDNA",
            "The BSPs for each ethnicity show that several groups, i.e., Lahu, Shan, Phutai, show a common trend of Ne increasing 30\u201350\u2009kya, and then stable until a decline \u223c2\u20135\u2009kya (Fig.\u00a06; BSPs for each individual population are in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S8). However, the Hmong and Karen showed a different pattern, namely a decrease in Ne \u223c5\u2009kya followed by rapid growth \u223c2.0\u20132.5\u2009kya for the Hmong, and ~1.0\u2009kya for the Karen. In general, the BSP plots for the AA (Mon, Htin, Lawa, and Khmer) and TK populations (Yuan, Phuan, and Lue) are similar to the BSPs observed for most of the groups in this study. The major TK groups (Khon Muenag, Central Thai, and Lao Isan) also showed a population increase \u223c10\u2009kya in our previous study. Interestingly, the distinct BSP plot of the Hmong, showing population increase during the Bronze/Iron Age, indicates different demographic changes in the maternal vs. paternal side and supports genetic differences of the Hmong from the other populations indicated by other results (Figs. 3, 4).",
            "Patrilocal vs. matrilocal genetic variation",
            "There are nine official hill tribes in Thailand: the AA-speaking Lawa, Htin, and Khmu; the HM-speaking Hmong and IuMien; and the ST-speaking Karen, Lahu, Lisu and Akha. The Lahu, Karen, and Htin are matrilocal (i.e., the husband moves to the residence of the wife after marriage) whereas the others are patrilocal. Our previous study had investigated four hill tribes (Lawa, Htin, Khmu, and Karen); here we add data from four additional hill tribes (Hmong, IuMien, Lahu, and Lisu) for a total of 23 populations belonging to eight hill tribes. Moreover, although the Palaung is not officially recognized as a hill tribe group, we include them in the analysis because they are a minority people from the same mountainous region of northern Thailand.",
            "The Hmong (HM1\u2013HM5), IuMien (Y1\u2013Y2), Lisu (LS), Khmu (KA), Lawa (LW1-LW3), and Palaung (PL) groups practice patrilocality, whereas the Htin (TN1\u2013TN3), Karen (KSK1\u2013KSK3, KPA, and KPW) and Lahu (MR and MB) are matrilocal. If genetic variation was influenced by residence pattern, then lower within-population genetic diversity coupled with greater genetic heterogeneity among populations is expected for matrilocal groups than for patrilocal groups for the mtDNA, whereas the opposite pattern is expected for the MSY. However, the MSY h and MPD values do not differ significantly between patrilocal and matrilocal groups (Supplementary Table\u00a0S9 and Fig. S9). For mtDNA, genetic diversity values are significantly higher for patrilocal than for matrilocal groups for h but the differences are not statistically significant for MPD (Supplementary Table\u00a0S9). Notably, the patrilocal groups HM1, HM4, and LS exhibit higher than average MPD values for the MSY (78.65\u201399.37, compared with the average of 51.74) and some matrilocal groups, e.g., KSK3 and TN1-TN2, show much lower MPD (6.92\u201320.69) than average (33.99) for mtDNA (Supplementary Table\u00a0S9). Furthermore, the genetic diversity of all Htin groups are much lower than the other groups (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S9).",
            "For genetic differences between populations revealed by AMOVA (Table\u00a01), the MSY genetic variation among patrilocal populations is much higher than that for mtDNA (MSY: 27.43%, P\u2009<\u20090.01; mtDNA: 6.36%, P\u2009<\u20090.01), while for the matrilocal groups the mtDNA genetic variation is much higher, but still less than that for the MSY (MSY: 24.49%, P\u2009<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 16.46%, P\u2009<\u20090.01). Much stronger contrasting between-group variation is seen in two patrilocal groups, i.e., Hmong (MSY: 18.13%, P\u2009<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 0.53%, P\u2009>\u20090.05) and Lawa (MSY: 35.65%, P\u2009<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 7.78%, P\u2009<\u20090.01) and one matrilocal Htin group (MSY: 9.85%, P\u2009<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 25.71%, P\u2009<\u20090.01) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S10). In contrast to our previous study, with the inclusion of the new KSK3 population, the matrilocal Karen shows more differentiation for the MSY than for mtDNA (MSY: 9.11%, P\u2009<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 5.85%, P\u2009<\u20090.01). When Hmong, IuMien, and Lahu from Thailand and Vietnam were combined, contrasting patterns of genetic variation between the MSY and mtDNA were still in accordance with expectations based on residence pattern, albeit the IuMien show only slightly higher between-group differentiation for the MSY than for mtDNA (Table\u00a01).",
            "Another potential effect of patrilocality vs. matrilocality is on the shared haplotypes between populations. If recent contact between populations is influenced by residence pattern, one would expect more MSY haplotype sharing among matrilocal groups than among patrilocal groups, and more mtDNA sharing among patrilocal groups than among matrilocal groups. However, the results for haplotype sharing between populations within matrilocal and patrilocal groups do not show a strong effect (Supplementary Table\u00a0S10). Haplotype sharing for the MSY is slightly lower on average for patrilocal groups (0.15) than for matrilocal groups (0.18), in accordance with expectations, but haplotype sharing for mtDNA is also lower on average for patrilocal groups (0.15) than for matrilocal groups (0.22), which is not in accordance with expectations based on residence pattern.",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "Our previous studies have focused on the genetic ancestry of the TK and AA groups in Thailand and Laos, here we investigate the less well-studied HM and ST speaking groups from Thailand, to gain more insights into the genetic history of MSEA. We sequenced \u223c2.3\u2009mB of the MSY and complete mtDNA genomes of the HM and ST groups who are regarded as hill tribes from northern Thailand, as well as additional TK groups from northern and northeastern Thailand. Although we focus on the HM and ST groups, we note that the previously-observed general pattern of overall genetic homogeneity of Thailand TK groups continues to be maintained with these additional TK groups, consistent with the idea that the TK language family spread via demic diffusion. However, an additional insight arises when we compare the Thai TK data to similar mtDNA and MSY data from Vietnamese TK groups: some of the TK-speaking groups from Vietnam (i.e., Nung, Tay, and Thai) are quite similar to the TK populations from northeastern Thailand (Phutai, Kalueang, and Black Tai) (Fig.\u00a05). This is in agreement with historical evidence for a migration of the ancestors of the Phutai, Kalueang, and Black Tai from Vietnam through Laos during last 200 years.",
            "Genetic differences between the Hmong and IuMien groups and their origins",
            "Previous studies of HM groups have reported sequences of the mtDNA hypervariable region 1 with some diagnostic coding SNPs to define haplogroups, and Y-STR variation and genotypes for Y chromosomal bi-allelic loci. Here we analyze complete mtDNA and partial MSY sequences from five Hmong and two IuMien populations from Thailand; strikingly, we find significant differences between Hmong and Mien populations in Thailand, with the IuMien more similar to other populations (Figs. 3, 4,\u00a0Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6, S7, Table\u00a01), while the Hmong show genetic distinction that was not previously documented in Thai/Lao populations (Figs. 3, 4, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0S6, S7 and Table\u00a01).",
            "Apart from the genetic distinction from their linguistic relatives, the IuMien, the Hmong in Thailand are genetically distinct from almost all other groups (Fig.\u00a03). There are no shared mtDNA haplotypes between HM populations and other Thai/Lao populations, and only a few shared MSY haplotypes (Fig.\u00a03a), moreover, they do not overlap with other groups in the MDS analysis (Fig.\u00a04), suggesting that they add unique genetic profiles that were not found in the previous studies of Thai/Lao AA, TK, and ST groups. This striking genetic divergence of Hmong populations in Thailand may reflect cultural isolation. Hmong communities have strong connections and prefer to marry with other Hmong groups rather than with non-Hmong groups. In contrast, the IuMien have shared haplotypes and closer genetic relatedness with several TK-speaking groups, indicating more contact with other groups. These results may reflect the pronounced IuMien culture for adoption. Based on ethnographic accounts from the 1960s, around 10\u201320% of adult IuMien were adopted from other ethnic groups (both highland and lowland), in order to increase the size of their household and their family\u2019s influence. Another factor behind the genetic similarity of IuMien with other East Asian populations could be admixture, as suggested by sharing of features between IuMien (but not Hmong) and Sinitic languages.",
            "Although the proto-HM groups were suggested to have originated in central and southern China during the Neolithic Period, their greatest ethnolinguistic diversity is found between the Yangtze and Mekong rivers today. In general, the ages of mtDNA and MSY haplogroups characteristic for HM groups are during the Holocene to the late Neolithic Period (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0S2, S3). This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence that the proto-HM group might be linked with the Neolithic cultures in the Middle Reach of the Yangtze River in southern China, namely the Daxi culture (5300\u20136400 kya) and the Qujialing culture (4600\u20135000 kya). Our results are also consistent with a recent study of HM groups from H\u00fan\u00e1n, China, which identified lineages within MSY haplogroup O-N5 as specific to Hmong (and dated to \u223c2.33\u2009kya) and mtDNA haplogroup B5a1c1a as correlating with Pahng and IuMien (and dated to \u223c9.80\u2009kya). However, we do find B5a1c1a* and B5a1c1a1 specific to Hmong, but not IuMien, in Thailand. Overall, the coalescent ages of both MSY and mtDNA lineages are in the same range.",
            "The origin of the Sino-Tibetan groups",
            "It has been proposed that Neolithic people living at least 6\u2009kya in northwestern China were probably the ancestors of modern ST populations. It has also been suggested that ST languages originated among millet farmers, located in North China, around 7.2\u2009kya or 5.9\u2009kya. Linguistic evidence then suggests differentiation between Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman languages, and also between Tibetan and Lolo-Burmese languages, and southward and westward expansions of ST groups.",
            "Although an MSY lineage (O-M122*) was proposed to be characteristic of all modern ST populations, subsequent studies have found further differentiation, e.g., haplogroup O2a1c-002611, which is at high frequency in Han Chinese but found at very low frequencies in Tibeto-Burman populations. Also, autosomal STR genotypes differentiate Tibetan and Lolo-Burmese speaking groups.",
            "ST-speaking groups in Thailand have not been studied in the same detail as those in China; here we analyzed three groups: Lisu, Lahu (Mussur), and Karen. Lisu and Lahu speak Lolo-Burmese languages, while the Karen languages belong to a different branch, Karenic. Historical evidence indicates that Lisu and Lahu migrated from southern China through Myanmar to northern Thailand about 100\u2013200 years ago. The Karen claim to be the first settlers in Myanmar who migrated from southern China before the arrival of Mon and Burmese people, and the Karen groups in Thailand have been migrating from Myanmar started around 1750 A.D. due to the growing influence of the Burmese.",
            "The genetic distances between the Lisu and Lahu are significantly different from zero for both mtDNA and the MSY, and they also share both mtDNA and MSY haplotypes (Fig.\u00a03a, b), indicating recent contact and/or shared ancestry. The two Lahu populations (Black Lahu (MB) and Red Lahu (MR)) are genetically similar to one another and both are genetically distinct from the other populations (Figs. 3b, 4b\u2013d). However, the Lisu do not differ significantly from many AA and TK populations (Fig.\u00a03b), suggesting interactions between the Lisu and other populations. For the Karen, we have added an additional Karen population (Skaw (KSK3)) to the previously studied Karen populations; KSK3 has very low haplogroup diversity and MPD values for the MSY (Fig.\u00a02), suggesting strong genetic drift that has in turn increased their divergence from the other Karen populations (Fig.\u00a04). This is in keeping with historical information: according to their oral history, KSK3 was founded ~60 years ago by just 18 households in a very remote region that is isolated from other Karen villages. The other Karen groups are genetically similar to several populations, and also share many basal mtDNA M haplogroups (M21a, M* and M91a) with neighboring Austroasiatic populations, especially the Mon, suggesting significant admixing (Supplementary Table\u00a0S8). Previous studies based on autosomal STRs and SNPs also support the relatedness of the Karen and other AA groups in Thailand.",
            "The estimated coalescent ages of the predominant lineages in ST populations provide an upper bound for their divergence/contact from other groups. MSY haplogroup O2a2b1a1-Page23, equivalent to O-M117, which was previously reported to be abundant in TB groups in southwestern China and in Han Chinese, was dated to around ~2.41\u2009kya in this study. However, this MSY lineage also occurs in HM, TK, and AA populations, reflecting recent shared ancestry and/or contact (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2). The ages of mtDNA haplogroups prevalent in Lahu and Lisu, namely A13, B4e, D4j1a1, and G1c, are dated to ~6.74, ~2.21, ~2.49, and ~2.20\u2009kya, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3). Thus, the coalescent ages of many MSY and mtDNA lineages prevalent in ST groups are around the time of the Han expansion (~2.5\u2009kya).",
            "Contrasting paternal and maternal genetic variation in patrilocal vs. matrilocal groups",
            "Previously, postmarital residence pattern has been shown to influence genetic variation in the hill tribes of Thailand. Our previous study had investigated four hill tribes: Lawa, Htin, Khmu and Karen. Here we added data from four additional hill tribes (Hmong, IuMien, Lahu, and Lisu) for the most detailed investigation to date, comprising a total of 23 populations belonging to eight hill tribes. The Hmong, IuMien, Lisu, Lawa and Khmu are patrilocal (i.e., the wife moves to the residence of the husband after marriage) whereas the others are matrilocal. If postmarital residence pattern is having an influence on patterns of genetic variation, we would expect larger between-group differences and smaller within-group diversity for patrilocal groups for the MSY, and the same trends for matrilocal groups for mtDNA.",
            "In general, the within-population genetic diversity values were not in agreement with expectations (Supplementary Table\u00a0S9 and Fig. S10) whereas genetic differentiation between populations did go in the direction predicted by postmarital residence pattern (Table\u00a01). However, when focusing on genetic differentiation within individual groups, the patrilocal Hmong and Lawa and the matrilocal Htin did fit with expectations, i.e., higher genetic differentiation among populations for the MSY than for mtDNA for the Hmong and Lawa, and the opposite for the Htin (Table\u00a01). However, the matrilocal Karen show higher differentiation for the MSY than for mtDNA (Table\u00a01), contrary to expectations and contrary to previous results based on four Karen populations. The addition of the KSK3 population increases the between-population MSY genetic variance from 2.3 to 9.1%, while the between-population mtDNA genetic variance is relatively unchanged. The low MSY MPD value (Fig.\u00a02c) and outlier position in the MSY MDS plots (Fig.\u00a04), as well as their oral history, indicate a strong effect of genetic drift on MSY variation in KSK3, which might then mitigate any influence of postmarital residence pattern on MSY vs. mtDNA variation. Interestingly, overall we find less contrast between matrilocal and patrilocal groups than found previously for the hill tribes. Presumably this is because of both more detailed sampling and higher-resolution analysis of the mtDNA and MSY genomes. And, this is not unexpected because while some studies find an impact of residence pattern on mtDNA/MSY variation, others do not. Many different factors can influence mtDNA/MSY variation, e.g., micro-evolutionarily factors such as genetic drift (as seen with the TN1, LW2 and KSK3 population), physical landscape, and other human cultural patterns, e.g., adoption in IuMien and cultural isolation and intermarriage in Hmong and Lawa; these can dilute or erase any potential impact of residence pattern.",
            "Nonetheless, one striking pattern remains in our data, and that concerns NEA vs. SEA ancestry. Previous genetic studies supported a north-south division in East Asian peoples and with some spread of northern ancestry to the south. There are distinct differences in the mtDNA and MSY lineages of NEA vs. SEA populations, and here we also find a higher frequency of both mtDNA and MSY lineages of SEA origin than of NEA origin in most of the studied populations. In general, the SEA specific maternal lineages (B5*, F1a*, M7b* and R9b*) are at an average frequency of 38.28%, while NEA mtDNA lineages (i.e., A*, D* and G*) have an average frequency of 9.38% (Supplementary Table\u00a0S8). The MSY haplogroups also show major SEA lineages (O1b*) predominating at an average frequency of 45.35%, and minor NEA lineages (C2e*, D-M174 and N*) at an average frequency of 8.33% (Supplementary Table\u00a0S7).",
            "However, the HM and ST groups are a dramatic exception to this general pattern of higher SEA than NEA ancestry for both paternal and maternal lineages (Fig.\u00a01). The estimated NEA maternal ancestry of the HM groups is 11.94%, comparable to that of other Thai/Lao populations (average\u2009=\u20099.11%), while the average frequency of NEA paternal lineages in HM groups is 24.72% (compared with the average frequency of 6.59% for other Thai/Lao populations). Conversely, in the ST groups we detect an average of 24.09% NEA maternal ancestry, which is much higher than the average NEA maternal ancestry for other Thai/Lao groups (7.57%), while the NEA paternal ancestry in ST groups is comparable to that in other Thai/Lao groups (11.95% vs. 7.88%).",
            "Given that both HM and ST groups originated from southern China or northwestern China, it is likely that the ancestral HM and ST groups both had relatively high levels of NEA ancestry for both the MSY and mtDNA, as this has been reported for contemporary Chinese populations (Supplementary Table\u00a0S5). We suggest that there was subsequent contact with SEA groups as their ancestors migrated southward, with HM populations incorporating more SEA maternal than paternal lineages, and ST populations incorporating more SEA paternal than maternal lineages. This could be explained if the ancestral HM group was patrilocal (as all HM populations are today), and so subsequent interactions between the HM ancestors and SEA groups incorporated more SEA mtDNA lineages than MSY lineages into HM populations. Conversely, if the ancestral ST group was matrilocal (as the Karen and Lahu are today), subsequent interactions between ST ancestors and SEA groups would have incorporated more SEA MSY lineages than mtDNA lineages into ST populations. Matrilocality for ancient ST groups has also been suggested based on linguistic evidence. The fact that some ST populations are now patrilocal (e.g., Lisu) while still exhibiting higher frequencies of NEA maternal lineages may then reflect recent changes from matrilocality to patrilocality.",
            "However, the interaction between NEA and SEA groups was undoubtedly a complex admixture process that started in prehistoric times and has continued into historic times, and there are many factors in addition to residence pattern that could have led to sex-biased admixture. Additional studies of both other ethnolinguistic groups (e.g., Akha, who show strong cultural practice preservation) as well as populations sampled from different villages of Lahu, Lisu, and IuMien from northern Thailand and Hmong and Karen (Skaw and Kayah) from western and central Thailand, are necessary to further investigate this pattern.",

            "We have carried out the most extensive study to date, using high-resolution methods, of the maternal and paternal lineages in HM and ST speaking groups of northern Thailand. We find unexpected differences between the Hmong and IuMien, which may reflect different cultural practices, and genetic heterogeneity among ST groups. Compared with previous studies, we find less contrast in genetic diversity and differentiation between matrilocal and patrilocal groups among the hill tribes. However, a novel finding of this study is the contrast between HM and ST groups, both assumed to have origins in southern China, in frequencies of NEA maternal and paternal lineages. We suggest that this striking difference reflects ancestral patrilocality for HM groups vs. ancestral matrilocality for ST groups. Overall, our results further attest to the impact of cultural practices on patterns of mtDNA vs. MSY variation in human populations.",

            "ABSTRACT",
            "Background",
            "Comparisons of maternally-inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and paternally-inherited non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY) variation have provided important insights into the impact of sex-biased processes (such as migration, residence pattern, and so on) on human genetic variation. However, such comparisons have been limited by the different molecular methods typically used to assay mtDNA and NRY variation (for example, sequencing hypervariable segments of the control region for mtDNA vs. genotyping SNPs and/or STR loci for the NRY). Here, we report a simple capture array method to enrich Illumina sequencing libraries for approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence, which we use to generate NRY sequences from 623 males from 51 populations in the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP). We also obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences from the same individuals, allowing us to compare maternal and paternal histories free of any ascertainment bias.",
            "Results",
            "We identified 2,228 SNPs in the NRY sequences and 2,163 SNPs in the mtDNA sequences. Our results confirm the controversial assertion that genetic differences between human populations on a global scale are bigger for the NRY than for mtDNA, although the differences are not as large as previously suggested. More importantly, we find substantial regional variation in patterns of mtDNA versus NRY variation. Model-based simulations indicate very small ancestral effective population sizes (<100) for the out-of-Africa migration as well as for many human populations. We also find that the ratio of female effective population size to male effective population size (Nf/Nm) has been greater than one throughout the history of modern humans, and has recently increased due to faster growth in Nf than Nm.",
            "Conclusions",
            "The NRY and mtDNA sequences provide new insights into the paternal and maternal histories of human populations, and the methods we introduce here should be widely applicable for further such studies.",
            "INTRO",
            "Background",
            "Comparisons of mtDNA and NRY variation have provided numerous important insights into the maternal and paternal histories of human populations. However, such comparisons are limited by methodological differences in how mtDNA and NRY variation have been typically assayed. MtDNA variation is usually investigated by sequencing hypervariable segments of the control region, (or, increasingly, via complete mtDNA genome sequences), while human NRY variation is routinely assayed by genotyping SNPs of interest, often in combination with short tandem repeat (STR) loci. Nevertheless, NRY SNP typing has several drawbacks due to the ascertainment bias inherent in the selection of SNPs. This ascertainment bias complicates many analyses of interest, such as dating the age of the NRY ancestor or particular divergence events in the NRY phylogeny, as well as demographic inferences such as population size changes. Moreover, the difference in molecular methods used to assay NRY versus mtDNA variation can complicate the interpretation of differences between patterns of NRY and mtDNA variation. For example, the seminal finding that NRY differences are bigger than mtDNA differences among global populations of humans, and that this is due to a higher rate of female than male migration due to patrilocality, may instead reflect methodological differences in how mtDNA versus NRY variation was assayed in that study.",
            "Another fundamental question concerns whether or not male and female effective population sizes have been the same over time. Attempts to address this question using the ratio of X chromosome to autosomal DNA diversity have come up with conflicting answers, which may in part reflect the use of different methods that capture information about effective population size at different times in the past. Moreover, the ratio of X to autosome diversity varies along the X chromosome, depending how far polymorphic sites are from genes, indicating a potential role for selection in distorting effective population size estimates from comparisons of X chromosome to autosomal DNA diversity. These and other fundamental aspects of human maternal and paternal demographic history remain unanswered.",
            "Recently, analyses have been carried out of NRY sequences obtained as part of whole genome sequencing projects. While these studies provide very detailed insights into the NRY phylogeny, they are nonetheless limited by the expense of whole genome sequencing, which precludes comprehensive global sampling. To allow for more accurate comparisons between mtDNA and NRY variation and to permit demographic inferences based on the NRY, we developed a capture-based array to enrich Illumina sequencing libraries for approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence. We used this approach to obtain NRY sequences from 623 males from 51 globally-distributed populations, and we also obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences from the same individuals, allowing us to investigate and directly compare the paternal and maternal relationships of global human populations in unprecedented detail.",
            "METHODS",
            "Methods",
            "Samples and sequencing library preparation",
            "The samples consist of 623 males (Additional file 1: Table S1) from the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP). The samples were taken from the subset \u2018H952\u2019, which excludes atypical, duplicated, and closely-related samples. Approximately 200\u00a0ng of genomic DNA from each sample was sheared by sonication using a Bioruptor system (Diogenode) and used to construct an Illumina Sequencing library with a specific double-index as described previously. The libraries were then enriched separately for NRY and mtDNA sequences as described below.",
            "Y-chromosome capture array design",
            "We targeted unique regions on the NRY that are free of repeats and to which the typically short next-generation sequencing reads could be mapped with high confidence. We used the UCSC table browser and the February 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) assembly and applied the following filter criteria. First, from the group \u2018variation and repeats\u2019, sequence regions annotated in the following tracks were removed: Interrupted Repeats, RepeatMasker, Simple Repeats, and Segmental Duplications. Next, we used the \u2018mapability\u2019 table \u2018CRG Align 75\u2019 from the group \u2018mapping and sequencing tracks\u2019 to identify and remove regions with mapability scores below 1. We then removed regions of less than 500\u00a0bp in order to reduce the number of fragments and thereby the number of fragment ends, which have low probe densities. We also removed 15mers that occurred more than 100 times in the hg19 genome assembly, as described previously, which resulted in splitting some target regions into sub-regions that were less than 500\u00a0bp. The final result was a total of approximately 500\u00a0kb of unique NRY sequence, distributed among 655 target regions ranging from 61\u00a0bp to 3.9\u00a0kb (Additional file 2: Table S2). These regions were then used to design a custom array (SureSelect 1\u00a0M capture array, Agilent) with 60\u00a0nt probes that were printed twice with a tiling density of 1\u00a0bp.",
            "NRY enrichment",
            "Up to 60 barcoded libraries were pooled in equimolar ratio. The library mix was enriched for target NRY regions by hybridization-capture on the custom designed array following the protocol described previously. After enrichment the library-pool was quantified by qPCR and then amplified to a total of approximately 1012 molecules. The final concentration and length distribution was measured on an Agilent DNA 100 microchip, and 10\u00a0nmol of the amplified library pool was used for sequencing. Each pool, consisting of 48 to 60 samples, was sequenced on a Solexa GAII lane using a paired end 75\u00a0cycle run plus two 7\u00a0nt index reads.",
            "MtDNA enrichment",
            "Up to 94 libraries were pooled in equimolar ratio and the library pool was enriched for mtDNA sequences by an in-solution hybridization capture method. The hybridization eluate was measured by qPCR and then amplified to produce a final concentration of 10\u00a0nmol. Up to 200 samples were sequenced on a Solexa GAII lane using a paired end 75\u00a0cycle run, plus two 7\u00a0nt index reads.",
            "Data processing",
            "In each Solexa GAII lane, 1% PhiX174 phage DNA was spiked in and used as a training set to estimate base quality scores with the IBIS base-caller. Reads with more than five bases having a PHRED scaled quality score below Q15 were discarded, as were reads having a single base quality in the index read (7\u00a0nt) score below Q10. Reads with no mismatches to the expected double index sequences were assigned to each individual sample library.",
            "For the NRY-enriched data, reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37) using default settings with BWA v0.5.10. We mapped to the whole genome rather than just the target region, in order to identify reads that might, with equal probability, map to another position in the genome. The bam files containing the mapping information and reads were processed with samtools v0.1.18. We used Picard 1.42 to mark duplicates, based on the start and end coordinates of the read pairs. The final SNP call was done on all samples simultaneously using the UnifiedGenotyper from the GATK v2.0-35 package and the following options: --output_mode EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES, --genotype_likelihoods_model SNP, --min_base_quality_score 20 and --heterozygosity 0.0000000001. The result was stored in a VCF file containing information for each callable site of the target region, and a second VCF file was created that contained only the variable positions among the 623 samples. For each sample at each variable position the PL scores were calculated with samtools; PL scores are normalized, PHRED-scaled likelihoods for the three genotypes (0/0, 0/1, 1/1) and are based on, among other things, coverage, base quality, and mapping quality. Positions that showed a difference in the PL score of less than 30 between homozygote reference (0/0) and homozygote alternative (1/1) were called an \u2018N\u2019 in that sample, as were positions where heterozygote calls (0/1) either had a higher PL score than the most likely homozygous genotype, or differed by less than 30 from the most likely homozygous genotype. Note that a PL score of 30 between genotype 0/0 and 1/1 means that the former is 1,000 times more likely than the latter, for example, the genotype-calling error rate is expected to be less than 1 in 1,000. Sites where more than two bases were called (that is, multi-allelic sites) were also removed.",
            "For the mtDNA-enriched data, reads were mapped to the revised mtDNA reference sequence (GenBank number: NC_012920) using the software MIA. The consensus sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (cmd line: muscle -maxiters 1 -diags mt_623seq.fasta mt_623seq.aln), and haplogroups were called with the HaploGrep software.",
            "Imputation for the NRY",
            "After quality filtering, there were 2,276 variable sites in the NRY sequences, with a total of 2.54% of the individual genotypes at variable positions scored as \u2018N\u2019 (that is, as missing data; the number of missing sites per individual ranged from 9 to 1,173, with an average of 122 missing sites per individual). Since missing data can influence the results of some analyses, we took advantage of the fact that the NRY target regions are completely linked with no recombination to impute missing data as follows. First, all sites with no missing data (605 sites) were used as the reference set to define haplotypes and calculate the number of differences between each haplotype. Sites with missing data were then imputed, beginning with the site with the smallest amount of missing data and proceeding sequentially. For each haplotype with missing data for that site, the missing base was imputed as the allele present in the reference haplotype that had the fewest differences (based on the sites with no missing data). After imputation was finished for that site, it was added to the reference set, and the procedure continued for the next site with the smallest amount of missing data.",
            "As a check on the accuracy of the imputation, we randomly deleted 2.54% of the known alleles, following the distribution of missing alleles in the full dataset, thereby creating an artificial dataset with a similar distribution of missing alleles as in the observed dataset. We then imputed the missing data according to the above procedure and compared the imputed alleles to the true alleles; this procedure was carried out 1,000 times. The imputed allele matched the true allele in 99.1% of the comparisons, indicating that the imputation procedure is quite accurate.",
            "Recurrent NRY mutations",
            "We expect the majority of the NRY SNPs to have mutated only once, as recurrent mutations in the known NRY phylogeny are quite rare. Therefore, as a further quality control measure, we investigated the NRY data for recurrent mutations by constructing a maximum parsimony tree for the 2,276 SNPs using programs in PHYLIP. We then estimated the number of mutations at each SNP, and removed 48 SNPs that had mutated more than twice, and only in terminal branches, as these are likely to reflect sequencing errors. The final dataset contains 2,228 SNPs.",
            "Data analysis",
            "Basic summary statistics (haplotype diversity, mean number of pairwise differences, nucleotide diversity, Tajima\u2019s D value and theta(S)) were calculated using Arlequin v3.5.1.3. Arlequin was further used to estimate pairwise \u03a6ST values and for Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA). The observed ratio of the mean pairwise differences (mpd) for the NRY versus mtDNA was calculated as mpdNRY/mpdmt. In order to detect group-specific deviations from the mean distribution of the mpd ratio in the dataset, we carried out a resampling approach. For each group sample size (Ngroup) we chose randomly Ngroup individuals (out of 623) and calculated the mpd ratio using the dist.dna command from the APE package in R. This was repeated 10,000 times for each Ngroup sample size to obtain the distribution of resampled mpd ratios.",
            "Divergence times in the NRY and mtDNA phylogenies were estimated using a Bayesian approach implemented in BEAST v1.6.2. For the mtDNA genome sequences we divided the alignment into two partitions consisting of the coding and non-coding regions, respectively. For both partitions we estimated the best fitting substitution model using jModeltest and the mutation rates estimated previously. These rates were calibrated by a combination of chimpanzee-human divergence and archaeological colonization dates, take into account time-dependency in the molecular clock, and are in the range of recent estimates of the mtDNA mutation rate. For the non-coding region we used the GTR\u2009+\u2009I\u2009+\u2009G substitution model and a mutation rate of 9.883\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128 substitutions/site/year, while for the coding region we used the TrN\u2009+\u2009I\u2009+\u2009G model and a mutation rate of 1.708\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128 substitutions/site/year. A strict clock and a constant size coalescence model were used, and the MCMC was run for 10 million steps with sampling from the posterior every 2,000 steps. The MCMC was run on five independent chains in parallel. After careful inspection of the log files in Tracer, the tree files of the five runs were merged after discarding the first 2,500 trees (50%) of each run as burn-in. A consensus tree was built from the merged trees using TreeAnnotator, and the consensus tree showing the divergence times for each node was visualized with FigTree.",
            "For the NRY sequences the same procedure was used, but modified as only variable sites were included in the BEAST analysis in order to reduce the computational time. The substitution model used was HKY without I\u2009+\u2009G, and the substitution rate was multiplied by the number of callable sites (501,108 sites) divided by the number of variable sites (2,228 sites). As there is uncertainty regarding the mutation rate, we ran the analysis twice, with a \u2018fast\u2019 rate of 1.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129 substitutions/site/year (transformed to 2.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127) and with a \u2018slow\u2019 rate of 6.17\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210 substitutions/site/year (transformed to 1.39\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127).",
            "Bayesian skyline plots were used to estimate population size change through time, using the same mutation rates and substitution models described above. The piecewise-linear Skyline coalescence model was chosen and the number of groups (bins) was set to half the sample size per group with a maximum of 20. A single MCMC chain was ran for 30 million steps and sampled every 3,000 steps from the posterior. The log file was inspected in Tracer for convergence of the chain and ESS values and the Bayesian Skyline Reconstruction was run.",
            "Simulations",
            "We used a simulation-based approach to estimate current and ancestral effective population sizes, based on either mtDNA or NRY sequences, for each regional grouping of populations. We started with the model of population history shown in Figure\u00a01, which consists of six geographic regions, and corresponds to a tree built from genome-wide SNP data from the HGDP populations, with the exception that Oceania branches off first among non-African populations in Figure\u00a01 rather than directly from East Asia. This alternative placement of Oceania is in keeping with subsequent studies of genome-wide data that have tested various models and found strongest support for an early branching of Oceanian population. The model includes 44 populations and 511 individuals; we excluded the Adygei, Uygur, Hazara, and all of the ME/NA populations as these exhibit high levels of admixture between the regional groups in genome-wide analyses. We first simulated the combined mtDNA and NRY sequences with the fastsimcoal software and used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate divergence times based on the combined dataset, with the same mtDNA mutation rate used in the BEAST analysis and an average of the fast and slow NRY mutation rates. We simulated 5,808,805 observations, which were log transformed via ABC linear regression using the following statistics: polymorphic sites (S), pairwise differences (Pi), Tajima\u2019s D, pairwise \u03a6 st , and the variance components for an AMOVA based on two groups, Africa versus non-Africa (the latter consisting of the pooled data from the five non-African regional groups). We then used this history (Figure\u00a01) and the mean divergence times based on the combined data in a further set of simulations to estimate from the mtDNA and NRY sequences the ancestral and current effective population sizes, for females and males, respectively, for each regional group of populations. We simulated 5,116,984 observations for the mtDNA sequences and 5,325,179 observations for the NRY sequences, and retained the top 1,000 simulations (tolerance of 0.03%) in each case for parameter estimation.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Results",
            "NRY and mtDNA diversity",
            "We obtained approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence from the 623 males in the HGDP, and complete mtDNA genome sequences from these 623 males plus an additional 329 females from the HGDP. The average coverage of the NRY sequences was 14.5X (range, 5X-37.5X, Additional file 3: Figure S1), while for the mtDNA genome sequences the average coverage was 640X (range, 46X-4123X, Additional file 3: Figure S1). After quality-filtering, imputation, and removal of sites with a high number of recurrent mutations, there remained 2,228 SNPs in the NRY sequences. The mtDNA analyses here are restricted to the 623 males for which NRY sequences were obtained, for which there were 2,163 SNPs; results based on the mtDNA genome sequences from the entire set of HGDP samples (952 individuals) did not differ from those based on the subset of 623 males (for example, Additional file 3: Figure S2). More details about the results from each individual, including mtDNA and NRY haplogroups, are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. The mtDNA sequences have been deposited in Genbank with accession numbers KF450814-KF451871. A datafile with the alleles at each of the NRY SNPs in each sample has been provided to the CEPH-HGDP and additionally is available from the authors. The NRY raw sequencing data are in the European Nucleotide Archive with the study accession number PRJEB4417 (sample accession numbers ERS333252-ERS333873).",
            "Basic summary statistics for the mtDNA and NRY diversity in each population are provided in Additional file 3: Table S3. As the sample sizes for many of the individual populations are quite small, for most subsequent analyses we grouped the populations into the following regions (based on analyses of genome-wide SNP data): Africa, America, Central Asia, East Asia, Europe, Middle East/North Africa (ME/NA), and Oceania (the regional affiliation for each population is in Additional file 1: Table S1). The Adygei, Hazara, and Uygur were excluded from these groupings as they show evidence of substantial admixture between these regional groups. We stress that the use of regional names is a convenience to refer to these groupings of these specific populations, and should not be taken to represent the entirety of the regions (for example, \u2018Africa\u2019 refers to the results based on the analysis of the combined African HGDP samples, not to Africa in general).",
            "Some basic summary statistics concerning mtDNA and NRY diversity for the regions are provided in Table\u00a01. The \u03c0 values we report are for the most part somewhat larger than reported in a previous study of eight Africans and eight Europeans, which is not unexpected given the much larger sampling in our study. Notably, we find substantial variation among geographic regions in amounts of mtDNA versus NRY diversity; this is shown further in the comparison of the mean number of pairwise differences (mpd) for mtDNA and the NRY (Figure\u00a02A). The mtDNA mpd for Africa is about twice that for other regions, while the NRY mpd is greatest in the Middle East/North Africa region, and only slightly greater in Africa than in the other regions (with the exception of the Americas, which show substantially lower NRY diversity). Overall, there are striking differences in the ratio of NRY:mtDNA mpd (Table\u00a01), with Africa, Central Asia, and the Americas having significantly less NRY diversity relative to mtDNA diversity, compared to the other regional groups. Moreover, differences in relative levels of NRY:mtDNA diversity are also evident in the individual populations (Additional file 3: Table S3), although the small sample sizes indicate that the individual population results must be viewed cautiously.",
            "NRY and mtDNA population differentiation",
            "An outstanding question is whether or not there are differences in the relative amounts of between-population versus within-population diversity for mtDNA versus the NRY, as some studies have found much larger between-population differences for the NRY than for mtDNA while others have not. To address this question, we carried out an AMOVA; the results (Figure\u00a02B) show that in the entire worldwide dataset, the between-population differences are indeed bigger for the NRY (approximately 36% of the variance) than for mtDNA (approximately 25% of the variance). However, there are substantial differences among the regional groups. The ME/NA, East Asia, and Europe regional groups follow the worldwide pattern in having bigger between-population differences for the NRY than for mtDNA. In contrast, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas have substantially bigger between-population differences for mtDNA than for the NRY, while for central Asia the between-population variation is virtually identical for the NRY and mtDNA. These regional differences likely reflect the influence of sex-biased migrations and admixture, as discussed in more detail below, and moreover indicate that focusing exclusively on the worldwide pattern of mtDNA versus NRY variation misses these important regional differences.",
            "We also investigated the relationship between geography and genetic distance. Despite the small sample sizes at the population level, both mtDNA and NRY \u03a6ST distances are significantly correlated with geographic distances between populations (Mantel tests with 1,000 replications: mtDNA, r\u2009=\u20090.41, P <0.001; NRY, r\u2009=\u20090.36, P\u2009=\u20090.002) as well as with each other (r\u2009=\u20090.23, P\u2009=\u20090.025). Thus, NRY and mtDNA divergence are both highly associated with geographic distances among populations.",
            "MtDNA and NRY phylogenies",
            "Although the primary purpose of this study is to compare demographic insights from mtDNA and NRY sequences that were obtained free of the ascertainment bias inherent in haplogroup-based approaches, we recognize that there is also useful information in the haplogroups. In this section we therefore present some haplogroup-based results. We first used a Bayesian method to estimate the phylogeny and divergence times for both mtDNA and the NRY (Figure\u00a03); for the latter, we used both a \u2018fast\u2019 mutation rate of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129/bp/year and a \u2018slow\u2019 mutation rate of 0.62\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129/bp/year as there is currently much uncertainty regarding mutation rates. The resulting phylogenies are in general consistent with the existing mtDNA and NRY phylogenies, although there are some discrepancies, for example, in the mtDNA tree (Figure\u00a03A) L1 sequences group with L0 sequences rather than on the other side of the root, while additional discrepancies can be found in the NRY trees. However, all of these discrepancies involve nodes that have low support values (red asterisks in Figure\u00a03) and hence low confidence; the nodes that have strong support values are all in agreement with the existing mtDNA and NRY phylogenies. The inability of the Bayesian analysis to completely resolve the phylogenies has two causes: for the mtDNA phylogeny, frequent back mutations and parallel mutations at some sites confounds the analysis; for the NRY phylogenies, some branches in the accepted phylogeny are supported by only a few SNP positions that are not included in our sequence data.",
            "The age of the mtDNA ancestor is estimated to be about 160 thousand years ago (kya), and the ages of the non-African mtDNA lineages M and N are about 65 to 70 kya, in good agreement with previous estimates. Our estimate for the age of the NRY ancestor is 103 kya based on the fast rate, and 165 kya based on the slow rate; however these estimates do not include the recently-discovered \u2018A00\u2019 lineage, which would result in much older ages for the NRY ancestor. The close agreement between the slow NRY ancestor age (165 kya) and the mtDNA ancestor age (160 kya) might be taken as evidence in favor of the slow NRY mutation rate. However, the slow NRY mutation rate gives an estimated age for the initial out-of-Africa divergence of about 100 kya, and an age for the divergence of Amerindian-specific haplogroup Q lineages of about 20 kya, while the fast rate gives corresponding estimates of about 60 kya for out-of-Africa and about 12.5 kya for Amerindian haplogroup Q lineages, in better agreement with the mtDNA and other evidence for these events. Given the current uncertainty over mutation rate estimates, we have chosen to use either both estimates in further analyses (for example, Bayesian skyline plots) or an average of the fast and slow rates (for example, in simulation-based analyses); in Additional file 3: Table S4 we provide divergence time estimates and associated 95% credible intervals for the branching events shown in the phylogenies in Figure\u00a03.",
            "NRY and mtDNA haplogroup frequencies per population are shown in Additional file 3: Table S5 and Additional file 3: Table S6, respectively. The mtDNA haplogroups were called from the sequences determined here, while the NRY haplogroups were previously determined by SNP genotyping. The NRY haplogroup information we provide is taken only from these published data; we did not infer haplogroups from the sequences, in order to have an independent comparison of the NRY tree with the haplogroups. The phylogenetic relationships for the NRY sequences are generally concordant with the SNP-genotyping results (with some exceptions, discussed in the legends to Figures S3 to S12 in Additional file 3). The haplogroup frequencies provide further insights into some of the different regional patterns of mtDNA versus NRY diversity noted previously. For example, the comparatively low diversity and smaller differences among populations for the NRY in Africa is due to the high frequency of NRY haplogroup E (55% to 100% in the non-Khoisan groups; Additional file 3: Table S5). This haplogroup is widespread in western Africa, and specific subhaplogroups of haplogroup E are associated with the Bantu expansion. The comparatively low NRY diversity in the HGDP Africa regional group thus likely reflects a \u2018homogenizing\u2019 effect of the Bantu expansion. NRY haplogroup E is also of interest because it occurs in some European and ME/NA groups, at frequencies of up to 17%, as well as in a few individuals from Central Asia (Additional file 3: Table S5). Inspection of the phylogeny of haplogroup E sequences (Additional file 3: Figure S7) reveals that all of the European and most of the ME/NA haplogroup E sequences form a clade distinct from the African haplogroup E sequences, and the age of this clade is about 18 kya. Moreover, all of the European haplogroup E sequences fall into a subclade that is about 14 kya. These results may reflect a migration from North Africa to Europe suggested from analyses of genome-wide SNP data, and would thus provide a timeframe for this migration.",
            "In Oceania, the bigger differences between populations for mtDNA than for the NRY (Figure\u00a02B, Table\u00a01) probably reflect the high frequency of mtDNA haplogroup B in just one of the two Oceania populations (75% in the Melanesian population vs. 0% in the Papuan population; Additional file 3: Table S6). MtDNA haplogroup B is associated with the Austronesian expansion. By contrast, NRY haplogroups associated with the Austronesian expansion, such as haplogroup O are absent in the HGDP Oceania populations (Additional file 3: Table S5). This contrast further testifies to the larger maternal than paternal impact of the Austronesian expansion on Oceanian populations.",
            "In the Americas, there are dramatic differences in mtDNA haplogroup frequencies among populations (the Karitiana and Surui are 100% haplogroup D, the Pima are 100% haplogroup C, the Maya are 100% haplogroup A, and the Colombians are 50% haplogroup B and 50% haplogroup C; Additional file 3: Table S6), which are at least partly due to the small sample sizes but also in keeping with previous studies. However, all NRY sequences from the Americas fall into haplogroup Q (with the exception of one Pima with a haplogroup G sequence that likely reflects recent European admixture), and overall NRY diversity is substantially reduced in the Americas, compared to mtDNA diversity (Table\u00a01, Figure\u00a02). While the small number of HGDP males from the Americas precludes any definitive statements, the apparently much greater mtDNA than NRY diversity in the Americas might indicate that fewer males than females were involved in the colonization of the Americas, and deserves further investigation.",
            "We note some additional features pertaining to specific populations in the individual NRY haplogroup phylogenies provided in Figures S3 to S12 in Additional file 3, while the full mtDNA phylogeny for the HGDP samples is provided in Figure S13 in Additional file 3.",
            "Demographic history",
            "Sequence-based analysis of NRY variation permits demographic analyses that cannot be carried out with ascertained SNP genotype data, and which can then be compared directly to similar analyses of the mtDNA sequences. In the following demographic analyses, only the sequence data were used, and not any of the haplogroup information. We first estimated the history of population size changes via Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) for the NRY and mtDNA sequences for each region (Figure\u00a04). These results should be interpreted cautiously, both because of the small sample sizes for some of the regions (in particular, America and Oceania), and because grouping populations with different histories can produce spurious signals of population growth. Moreover, the uncertainty concerning the NRY mutation rate makes it more difficult to compare the timing of population size changes for the NRY versus mtDNA. Nevertheless, both the mtDNA and NRY BSPs indicate overall population growth in almost all groups, but for mtDNA there is a more pronounced signal of growth at around 15,000 to 20,000\u00a0years ago than there is for the NRY, and during much of the past it appears as if the effective size for females was larger than that for males (Figure\u00a04).",
            "To further investigate female and male demographic history, we used simulations and ABC to estimate the current and ancestral effective population size for females (Nf) and males (Nm) for Africa, Europe, East Asia, Central Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. We also estimated the ancestral Nf and Nm for the out-of-Africa migration. We first used the model in Figure\u00a01 and the combined mtDNA and NRY sequences (using an average of the fast and slow mutation rates for the latter) to estimate the divergence times associated with this model (with the prior distributions for the divergence times given in Table\u00a02). Table\u00a02 also provides measures of the reliability of the resulting parameter estimation based on the pseudo-observed values: average R2\u2009=\u20090.9, which exceeds the suggested threshold of 10%; average coverage is 89% and factor 2 (proportion of estimated values for the statistics that are within 50% to 200% of the true value) is 90%; the average bias is 2% and relative mean square error (RMSE) is 9%. As these measures indicate satisfactory performance of the simulation, we retained the top 1,000 simulations (tolerance of 0.02%) for estimating the divergence times. In addition, the posterior distributions show a markedly improved fit to the summary statistics, compared to the prior distributions (Additional file 3: Table S7, Figure S14). The resulting estimates of divergence times for the model in Figure\u00a01 are provided in Table\u00a02, and are generally in good agreement with previous estimates for the divergence time among continental groups.",
            "Coverage is the proportion of times the true value for the parameter lies within the 90% credible interval around the parameter estimate; and Factor 2 is the proportion of estimated values that are within 50% and 200% of the true value.",
            "We next carried out separate simulations based on NRY and mtDNA sequences, respectively, and obtained ABC estimates of current and ancestral Nm and Nf for each regional group and for the out-of-Africa migration. Although the reliability measures indicate greater variance in the simulation results (Tables\u00a03 and 4), the posterior distributions still show a markedly improved fit to the summary statistics (Additional file 3: Tables S8 and S9; Figures S15 and S16). The distribution of the estimated current and ancestral Nf and Nm are shown for each regional group in Figure\u00a05, and a pictorial summary is provided in Figure\u00a06. The simulation results suggest a small founding size in Africa of about 60 females and 30 males (all population sizes are effective population sizes); migration out of Africa about 75 kya associated with a bottleneck of around 25 females and 15 males; migrations from this non-African founding population to Oceania 61 kya, to Europe 49 kya, to Central and East Asia 37 kya, and from East Asia to the Americas about 15 kya. These divergence times are in reasonable agreement with those in the mtDNA and NRY phylogenies, given the wide confidence intervals on both (Table\u00a02, Additional file 3: Table S4). There was concomitant population growth in all regions (with the most growth in East Asia); however, throughout history the mtDNA and NRY results indicate consistently larger effective population sizes for females than for males (except, possibly, in the ancestors of East Asians).",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "We report here the development and implementation of a capture-based array method to enrich Illumina sequencing libraries for NRY sequences. We then used this method to obtain approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence for 623 males from 51 populations of the CEPH-HGDP, and we also obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences from the same individuals. The molecular resolution (that is, number of SNPs) provided by the NRY and mtDNA sequences was roughly equivalent overall (2,228 NRY SNPs, vs. 2,163 mtDNA SNPs), allowing us to compare the maternal and paternal histories of human populations without the usual concerns about different methodologies (for example, mtDNA HV1 sequences vs. genotyping NRY SNPs and/or STRs) having an influence on the results. However, note that in other respects the molecular resolution still differs between the mtDNA and NRY sequences, for example, we obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences but only partial NRY sequences.",
            "Our data provide new insights into the maternal versus paternal history of humans. First, a longstanding controversy has been whether or not genetic differences between human populations are bigger, on average, for the NRY than for mtDNA. The first comparative study of human mtDNA and NRY diversity found significantly bigger differences between populations for the NRY than for mtDNA, which was attributed to a higher female than male migration rate between populations due to patrilocality. A subsequent study found bigger differences between populations for the NRY than for mtDNA in patrilocal populations and the opposite pattern in matrilocal populations, which was viewed as supporting an influence of residence pattern and associated male versus female migration rates on NRY versus mtDNA diversity. However, these studies used different methods to assay NRY versus mtDNA diversity; notably, a later study that used similar methods to assay NRY and mtDNA diversity (by comparing 6.7\u00a0kb of NRY sequence and 770\u00a0bp of mtDNA sequence in 389 individuals from 10 populations) concluded that genetic differences between populations were in fact similar for the NRY and mtDNA.",
            "Our results, based on a more comprehensive sampling of worldwide human populations, indicate that genetic differences among human populations at the global scale are indeed bigger for the NRY than for mtDNA, although the differences are not as large as suggested by previous studies (between-population variance of 36% for the NRY vs. 25% for mtDNA in this study, compared to previous estimates of 65% for the NRY vs. 20% for mtDNA). More importantly, our results indicate substantial differences among regional groups in the between-group variance for the NRY versus mtDNA (Figure\u00a02) as well as in overall levels of NRY versus mtDNA diversity (Figure\u00a02, Table\u00a01). Thus, focusing on global patterns of variation misses this important regional variation, which (as discussed in more detail above in the Results) likely reflects differences in the paternal versus maternal demographic history of specific human populations (for example, the large impact of the Bantu expansion on African NRY diversity, and of the Austronesian expansion on Oceanic mtDNA diversity).",
            "Another question of interest is the extent to which the genetic contributions of males versus females have been the same or differed (as measured by their respective effective population sizes, Nm and Nf, respectively). Previous studies of Nm and Nf have largely relied on comparisons of X chromosome vs. autosomal variation, and have come to varying conclusions concerning the historical Nf/Nm ratio, for example, finding that this ratio suggests a large excess of Nf to Nm\u00a0, a moderate excess of Nf to Nm\u00a0, or even a decreased Nf relative to Nm\u00a0. These differences variously reflect methodological differences, difficulties in accounting for differences in male versus female mutation rates, and/or the potentially greater effect of selection on the X chromosome than on the autosomes. Comparison of mtDNA versus NRY variation offers a more direct assessment of Nf/Nm that is free of some of the issues concerning X:autosome comparisons (albeit not all, as discussed below), but requires unbiased estimates of NRY variation, which until our study were only available from either whole genome sequencing studies or more limited targeted studies of NRY sequence variation. Our results indicate a consistent strong excess of Nf versus Nm starting even before the out-of-Africa migration that has been carried through almost all subsequent migrations. East Asia may be an exception, and indeed our estimates of Nf and Nm are substantially larger than previous estimates of Ne in east Asians based on autosomal diversity. However, these previous studies were based solely on data from Han Chinese and Japanese, whereas the HGDP includes a much more diverse sampling of east Asian populations, which may account for the higher effective population size estimates for the HGDP. The excess of Nfversus Nm become even more pronounced in recent times due to higher rates of growth in Nf than in Nm (Figures\u00a04, 5, and 6); these results are in line with previous studies of smaller datasets that used different methods. These results suggest, in turn, that sex-specific processes that reduce Nm, such as polygyny and/or sex-specific migration, have characterized humans over most of our prehistory.",
            "However, there are several reasons why this conclusion should be viewed as tentative. First, the sample sizes of some of the regional groups in the HGDP are quite low, precluding confident estimates of effective population sizes. Moreover, there are some surprising features of our results, such as the much larger effective size estimates for East and Central Asians than for Europeans. Whether these features are truly indicative of these regions, or rather specific to the particular populations sampled in the HGDP, will require further studies to elucidate. Nonetheless, given that the HGDP overall is a much more comprehensive sampling of worldwide genetic diversity than in previous studies that estimated effective population sizes for various human populations, it perhaps is not surprising that we obtain different results.",
            "Second, while focusing on NRY versus mtDNA variation avoids some of the drawbacks of comparing X versus autosomal DNA variation in estimating Nf and Nm, the uncertainty associated with the resulting estimates is significantly larger for NRY:mtDNA than for X:autosome comparisons. This is because the X:autosome comparisons are averaged across many independent loci, whereas the NRY and mtDNA are each just a single independent locus.",
            "Third, the model used in the simulations is obviously a very simplified version of reality, and indeed there are some clear differences between the observed values for some summary statistics and the posteriors (for example, the \u03a6ST values in Figures S14 to S16 in Additional file 3). In particular, to reduce the computational complexity we did not consider migration between regional groups (after the initial colonization events) in the simulations to estimate Nf and Nm. There is some justification for doing so, as in general migration within the regional groups has been more important than migration between regional groups, as evidenced by genetic structure analyses and by attempts to estimate migration rates directly from genetic data. Moreover, no mtDNA sequences are shared between regional groups, and only one NRY sequence is shared between regional groups, suggesting very limited recent migration between regional groups. Furthermore, by not including migration we are overestimating the ancestral Nf and Nm (because some of the diversity reflects later migration rather than genetic diversity that was present in the ancestral population). Thus, the effect of such migration would be even smaller estimates of Nf and Nm than those we obtained. Still, in future analyses migration and other complexities should be considered.",
            "Fourth, we have here interpreted differences in levels of NRY versus mtDNA diversity and divergence as reflecting neutral, demographic history. However, a recent study has shown that background selection on the Y chromosome is probably also influencing levels of NRY diversity in human populations. The substantial regional variation that we see in comparisons of mtDNA versus NRY diversity does suggest that there are regional differences in the demographic history of males and females, as it seems unlikely that levels of background selection would vary so drastically across human populations. Moreover, recently-described regional variation in ratios of X:autosomal diversity also point to sex-biased demographic processes. Still, the overall differences we find in Nmversus Nf may be influenced by background selection, and hence may not be as large as inferred by the simulations (for example, Figure\u00a06). More detailed investigations are warranted into the relative importance of background selection versus purely demographic processes in influencing regional variation in Nm vs. Nf.",
            "CONCL",
            "Conclusions",
            "We have developed a rapid and cost-effective means of obtaining unbiased, high-resolution NRY sequence information. Comparative analysis of NRY and mtDNA sequences from a large sample of individuals and populations from the HGDP provides new insights into the comparative demographic history of males and females. In particular, we find on average larger genetic differences between populations for the NRY than for mtDNA (albeit with substantial regional variation), and that the effective population size of females has been larger than that of males throughout human history. We anticipate that using this approach to investigate additional populations should provide a rich source of new information about the genetic history of our species.",

            "Biological Sexing of a 4000-Year-Old Egyptian Mummy Head to Assess the Potential of Nuclear DNA Recovery from the Most Damaged and Limited Forensic Specimens",
            "ABSTRACT",
            "High throughput sequencing (HTS) has been used for a number of years in the field of paleogenomics to facilitate the recovery of small DNA fragments from ancient specimens. Recently, these techniques have also been applied in forensics, where they have been used for the recovery of mitochondrial DNA sequences from samples where traditional PCR-based assays fail because of the very short length of endogenous DNA molecules. Here, we describe the biological sexing of a ~4000-year-old Egyptian mummy using shotgun sequencing and two established methods of biological sex determination (RX and RY), by way of mitochondrial genome analysis as a means of sequence data authentication. This particular case of historical interest increases the potential utility of HTS techniques for forensic purposes by demonstrating that data from the more discriminatory nuclear genome can be recovered from the most damaged specimens, even in cases where mitochondrial DNA cannot be recovered with current PCR-based forensic technologies. Although additional work remains to be done before nuclear DNA recovered via these methods can be used routinely in operational casework for individual identification purposes, these results indicate substantial promise for the retrieval of probative individually identifying DNA data from the most limited and degraded forensic specimens.",
            "INTRO",
            "1. Introduction",
            "On 18 October 2009, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA) opened an exhibition called The Secrets of Tomb 10A: Egypt 2000 BC. One of the most intriguing items in the collection was a mummified human head discovered over a century ago in the necropolis of Deir el-Bersha (also known as Dayr al-Barsh\u0101). The site is located on the east bank of the Nile River in close proximity to the city of Mallawi, approximately 250 km south of Cairo. Deir el-Bersha is known for tombs cut into cliffs of limestone that date back to the Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC), the First Intermediate Period (about 2100\u20132040 BC) and the Middle Kingdom (MK; 2040\u2013approx. 1640 BC). During the MK 11th and 12th Dynasties (2040\u20131783 BC), it served as the chief cemetery for the governors or regional lords (a.k.a. nomarchs) of the 15th Upper Egyptian Nome (a.k.a. the Hare Nome). ",
            "In 1915, Deir el-Bersha was excavated by a joint MFA-Harvard University team directed by George A. Reisner with the assistance of Hanford L. Story and Said Ahmed Said. On 23 April, Reisner\u2019s men began clearing the burial shaft from tomb number 10A. Six days later, at the bottom of a 30-foot pit, they discovered the burial chamber of an early MK governor named Djehutynakht. It is not yet clear whether he is Djehutynakht IV, son of Ahanakht I, or Djehutynakht V, son of Nehri I. Both were nomarchs of the Hare Nome, and while they shared the same name (which means Thoth [the main local deity] is Strong), there is no evidence they were related. Tomb 10A contained a second occupant: the governor\u2019s wife, who was also called Djehutynakht. Although the tomb had been plundered in antiquity and most of the valuable jewels stolen, many objects were left behind. In fact, the recovered contents of Tomb 10A are considered one of the largest burial assemblages of the MK ever discovered. The funerary equipment includes pottery, canopic jars, models showing men and women in different daily life activities, nearly 60 model boats, and a famous, exquisitely carved and painted processional group composed of a priest and four offering bearers, known as the \u201cBersha procession\u201d. Befitting their high status, the governor and his wife were both buried in finely decorated rectangular wooden coffins placed within larger coffins, all made of thick cedar of Lebanon boards. Upon discovery, the coffins of the governor were nearly intact with the exception of the head end that had been removed by tomb robbers. The intricate carvings and paintings on the governor\u2019s outer coffin make it an unparalleled masterpiece of MK art (see pictures in). ",
            "When the tomb was looted, the mummies of the governor and his wife were damaged by thieves in search of fine jewelry. A torso, originally attributed to Lady Djehutynakht, was found in the far corner of the burial chamber, but was recently argued to belong to the governor after re-excavation of Tomb 10A. A mummified head, which could neither be attributed to the governor nor to his wife, was found atop the governor\u2019s coffin (Figure 1). ",
            "In an effort to learn more, the head was analyzed with computerized tomography (CT) in 2005. The CT scanning of the head revealed extensive bilateral post-mortem alterations of the facial bones. The absence of these bones, together with the lack of comparative data on ancient Egyptian skulls, preclude definitive morphological sex determination; however, the presence of large mastoid processes, robust occipital and temporal regions, and pronounced gonial flaring of the mandible, suggest that the skull more likely belonged to a man, (Figure S1). In order to unequivocally determine the biological sex of the individual, the MFA collaborated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory to perform DNA analysis.",
            "At the time the FBI was contacted, the ancient DNA community had largely given up on the testing of ancient Egyptian human remains. Though DNA extraction and amplification from ancient Egyptian samples had been attempted in the early days of paleogenetics, these initial attempts either resulted in failure (4500-year-old human femurs) or yielded data that turned out to be the product of modern DNA contamination (2400-year-old mummy and 1600-year-old sacred monkey bones from the Saqqara Baboon Galleries), both contaminated with modern human DNA). These early failures prompted studies on DNA survival. Together with older research showing that DNA degradation (depurination in particular) is primarily influenced by temperature, pH, oxygen, and water, these analyses suggested that Egyptian environmental conditions likely cause DNA to degrade to fragments smaller than 100 base pairs (bp) in just a few hundred years.",
            "Currently, forensic DNA testing at the FBI, as well as in nearly all global operational laboratories, is based on targeted PCR amplification of fragments ranging from 90\u20131200 bp in size, followed by size-based capillary electrophoresis for short tandem repeats (STRs) or Sanger sequencing for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These approaches have served the forensic community well over the past twenty years. They present limitations, however, to both the quality and quantity of genetic data that can be recovered from the most challenging specimens. Recently, a number of commercial high throughput sequencing (HTS) assays, designed specifically for forensic applications, have become available. While these assays overcome many of the limitations of traditional capillary electrophoresis-based forensic DNA analyses, they are still based on targeted amplification of defined genomic regions. As a result, their utility is limited to samples harboring DNA fragments large enough for PCR amplification.",
            "One of the primary advantages of HTS is that DNA fragments of very short size can be recovered and sequenced, thus obviating the need for targeted PCR. Here, we exploit this feature and describe the use of shotgun sequencing to determine the biological sex of a 4000-year-old Egyptian mummy. ",
            "METHODS",
            "2. Materials and Methods",
            "2.1. Tooth Extraction",
            "In 2009, a second mandibular molar, in pristine condition, was extracted from the skull using a flexible fiber optic endoscope with grasping forceps. Immediately following its extraction, the molar was placed in a sterile container and sent to a DNA laboratory where it was embedded in epoxy and cut in two parts (see photo in Figure 2). The block containing the crown and upper roots (~2/3 of the tooth) was sent to the FBI Laboratory and later to the Harvard Medical School (HMS) ancient DNA facility.",
            "2.2. Strategy for Analyses",
            "Given our understanding that the recovery of DNA from a 4000-year-old Egyptian mummy specimen would be challenging, if not impossible, the first goal was to determine whether any endogenous mitochondrial DNA could be recovered from the sample. On a practical level, the high copy number of the mitochondrial genome (mtGenome) per cell significantly improves the chances of recovering genetic material from ancient samples. Furthermore, because consistently higher HTS coverage is achieved with mtDNA than with nuclear DNA, the authenticity of the genetic data can be more easily addressed. Data authenticity was assessed in three ways. First, the average size of the human mtDNA sequences was determined bioinformatically. Given the ancient Egyptian origin of the sample, the recovered fragments were expected to be very small as a result of DNA degradation over time, while modern contamination would be more likely to contain longer fragments. Second, the occurrence and pattern of one particular type of DNA damage was evaluated. Hydrolytic deamination results in the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the DNA. It is one of the most abundant forms of damage in aged DNA molecules and manifests in the final DNA sequence data as conversion of cytosine to thymine (C-T) or, in the reverse complementary sequence, guanine to adenine (G-A), especially at the ends of molecules. Finally, the rate of modern DNA contamination in the data was estimated by comparing the data to modern human mtDNA diversity. As mtDNA is a haploid marker, contaminating molecules can be more easily detected than is possible with diploid nuclear DNA.",
            "2.3. Sample Preparation",
            "A full description of the sample preparation is provided in the Supplementary Material.",
            "At the FBI Laboratory, DNA was extracted from 105 mg of dentin powder using a silica column-based protocol. In order to remove damaged bases, the extract and associated extraction reagent control (RB) were treated for one hour with the USERTM kit, which contains a mixture of Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG) and Endo VIII (New England BioLabs, a.k.a. NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). At the library preparation stage, a third sample, containing only water, was introduced (negative control or NC). Illumina libraries were generated for each sample (Lib1, Lib1/RB, Lib1/NC) using the NEBNext Ultra II for Illumina kit and NEB looped adaptors. After amplification and indexing, all three libraries were subjected to hybridization capture to enrich for human mtDNA with a MyBait1 kit (Arbor Biosciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and the post-capture products (cap-Lib1; cap-Lib1/RB; cap-Lib1/NC) were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq FGX at the FBI Laboratory (Figure 2). Having established the presence of endogenous DNA at the FBI Laboratory, the tooth was sent to the HMS, where a second extract and library were prepared. ",
            "At the HMS, DNA was extracted from 68 mg of powder using the protocols published in and. The extract, and associated RB and NC, were treated with UDG according to. By using this treatment, called \u201cpartial UDG removal\u201d, almost all the uracil present in the ancient DNA molecules are removed except a few located at the ends of the molecule. Next, three Illumina libraries (Lib2, Lib2/RB, and Lib2/NC) were prepared according to. Fifteen microliters of barcoded Lib2, and 10 \u00b5L of Lib2/RB and Lib2/NC were shipped to the FBI Laboratory where 5 \u03bcL of each library was dual-indexed with eight cycles of PCR. At the FBI Laboratory, mtDNA hybridization capture was performed on the three Harvard libraries using a MyBait1 kit. Cap1-Lib2/RB and cap1-Lib2/NC were sequenced on the MiSeq FGX while cap-Lib1 and cap1-Lib2 were sequenced together on a HiSeq 2500 at the National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC). A second mtDNA enrichment on Lib2, Lib2/RB and Lib2/NC was performed at the HMS using a pool of oligonucleotides, synthesized on a microarray (CustomArray Inc., Bothell, WA, USA). Cap2-Lib2, cap2-Lib2/RB, and cap2-Lib2/NC were sequenced at the HMS on a NextSeq 500.",

CutAdapt (v1.9.1) was used to remove the 7 bp barcodes in Lib2 and cap1-Lib2. For every run except the NextSeq run, paired reads were mapped to the human genome hg19 and the revised Cambridge reference sequence rCRS (NC012910) using the Burrows\u2013Wheeler Aligner (BWA aln v.0.7.13-r1126) with the parameters recommended by (\u201c\u2212l 16500 \u2212n 0.01 \u2212o 2\u201d).

Similarly, data produced with cap1-Lib2 and cap2-Lib2 (runs III and IV) were merged into a CAP-LIB2 file (Figure 2). For all data sets, duplicates were removed after merging. Reads shorter than or equal to 35 bp were removed from all data sets to avoid spurious microbial alignments (as suggested by) and reads longer than 70 bp (that could potentially originate from modern contaminants) were removed before variant calling.

            "2.4.2. Shotgun Sequence Analysis for Biological Sex Determination",
            "Two established methods that have been successfully applied in a number of previous studies were used to determine the sex of the individual from whom the tooth was obtained. Biological sex was first determined using RY, which is defined as the number of reads that mapped to chromosome Y (nY) divided by the number of reads mapped to both the X and Y chromosomes (nX + nY). The 95% confidence interval (CI) is defined as RY \u00b1 1.96 standard error (SE), where SE = \u221a[(RY x (1 \u2212 RY))/nX + nY]. The results are indicative of a female when the upper bound of the 95% CI is less than 0.016, whereas the results are indicative of a male when the lower bound of the CI is greater than 0.075.",
            "The second method, RX, compares the number of sequences originating from the X chromosome to the number of sequences originating from the 22 autosomes. Molecular sex is assigned male if the upper bound of the 95% CI is less than 0.60, and female if the lower bound is greater than 0.80 (see RX CI definition in the Supplementary Material).",
            "In order to mitigate against the possible impact of modern contaminants on the calculation, RX and RY were also determined using only reads showing signs of damage, as these reads are unlikely to have originated from modern contaminants. Read filtering was performed using PMDtools (v0.50) with a threshold of three, as recommended by the author of the program.",
            "RESULTS",
            "3. Results",
            "3.1. Data Authentication Based on Captured mtDNA Reads",
            "Sequencing results for all four post-capture library runs are presented in Supplementary Table S1. The size distributions of the mapped mtDNA reads from the merged datasets (CAP1-LIB1 and CAP2-LIB2) are presented in Figure 3a,b. The vast majority of reads from the FBI library (CAP1-LIB1) were between 35 and 80 bp, with a mode around 47 bp. The majority of the HMS library reads, on the other hand, were between 25 and 70 bp, with a mode around 38 bp. The shorter average length of the captured mtDNA sequence in the Harvard library (Figure 3b) reflects the efficiency of the extraction protocol from in retaining the smallest molecules. ",
            "The final numbers of unique reads (Q score >30; size ranging from 36 to 70 bp) were 14,408 for CAP-LIB1 and 26,502 for CAP-LIB2 (40,910 reads in total). The total number of mtDNA bases sequenced was ~1.8 million (703,905 for CAP-LIB1 and 1,096,128 for CAP-LIB2). When aligned to the mtGenome, coverage of any given position ranged from 5\u00d7 to 247\u00d7, with an average coverage of 108\u00d7 (Figure 4). ",
            "3.2. Quantification of Deamination",
            "Despite the fact that DNA damage resulting from deamination slowly accumulates over time, deamination does not strictly correlate with sample age. Environmental conditions, in addition to age, can significantly impact DNA damage. High temperatures and humidity generally increase the speed of degradation, while cold and dry climates generally favor preservation. A 22,000-year-old bone preserved in permafrost can exhibit a C-T substitution frequency at the 5\u2019 end of less than 0.20, while a much younger, 6500-year-old human tooth found in Spain can exhibit rates greater than 0.25. Even if the C-T substitution frequency cannot be used as a strict dating tool, deamination rates are generally expected to be greater than 0.1 in unrepaired DNA extracted from samples greater than 500 years of age that have not been preserved in ice. ",
            "In the present study, the C-T substitution frequency at the 5\u2019 end of the mtDNA reads in Cap-Lib1 was 0.27 (Figure S2A). This high value was somewhat unexpected since the extract had been treated with UDG (an enzyme that cleaves uracil) and only sporadic uracil bases should have remained. These results suggest that the reaction was partially or completely inhibited. Conversely, and as expected for the partial UDG treated cap1-Lib2, very few uracil bases remained in the mtDNA reads, resulting in a nucleotide misincorporation rate of 0.084 at the 5\u2019 end (Figure S2C). Since it has been shown in that a successful \u201cpartial UDG treatment\u201d generally results in the misincorporation rate to be reduced by three-fold, it is likely that our USER reaction performed on Lib1 was completely inhibited. ",
            "3.3. Contamination",
            "Sequencing statistics for the reagent blank and negative control libraries are presented in Table 1. No signs of measurable human contamination that could have impacted results from the tooth were observed. The vast majority of reads did not map to the human genome and most likely originate from environmental DNA that was present in the tooth, the laboratory, and/or the reagents.",
            "Modern human contamination in the mtDNA data, as assessed using ContamMix, was estimated at 0.6% (95% CI 0.08\u20131.8%) in CAP-Lib1 and 11.6% in CAP-Lib2 (95% CI 9.7\u201313.6%). The value for Lib1 is consistent with the rates observed in other ancient DNA studies. Though the estimated contamination rate in Lib2 was somewhat higher, it had no effect on consensus calling for the endogenous molecules, as the same mtGenome profile was recovered from both libraries.",
            "3.4. Mitochondrial Haplotype",
            "The mtGenome profile independently obtained from the tooth by the FBI and HMS laboratories were identical and can be found in Table S2. The haplotype (deposited in GenBank under accession number MG736653) belongs to mitochondrial DNA lineage U5b2b5, but the specific sequence has not been previously reported in the 35,942 mtGenomes stored in the NCBI GenBank database (as of October 2017). The sequence closest to the mummy\u2019s belongs to a contemporary individual from Lebanon (KT779192); however, the two haplotypes still differ at five positions, three of them in the control region (CR). A comparison between the mummy CR and the 26,127 CR sequences from the EMPOP database produced no match. ",
            "To better understand the mtDNA lineage of the mummy in the context of known Egyptian mtDNA diversity, the mummy haplogroup was compared to the mtDNA haplogroup distribution of 668 Egyptians from various modern populations. The dominant haplogroups among this dataset were haplogroup T (11.98%) and L3 (11.23%; Table S3). Out of the 64 individuals who belonged to haplogroup U, seven belonged to haplogroup U5 (1.05%), and three (0.5%) belonged to one of the U5b subgroups (U5b1c; U5b1d1a; U5b2a5). ",
            "The Djehutynakht sequence was also compared to available ancient human DNA sequences (Table S4). Not surprisingly, no direct matches to the Djehutynakht sequence have been reported. However, related U5b2b sequences have been observed in ancient human remains from Europe, and a haplogroup U5b2c1 haplotype was recently discovered in 2000-year-old remains from Phoenicia. When only the mtDNA sequences recovered from ancient Egyptian human remains are considered, the Djehutynakht sequence most closely resembles a U5a lineage from sample JK2903, a 2000-year-old skeleton from Abusir el-Meleq.",
            "3.5. Shotgun Sequencing",
            "Shotgun sequencing statistics are presented in Table 2. Although aliquots of libraries Lib1 and Lib2 were mixed (50/50) and sequenced together on the HiSeq, the Lib2 data values were, for all measures, substantially higher than the Lib1 values. This is perhaps due to the smaller overall size of the HMS library fragments (Figure S3). As smaller fragments are known to be preferentially sequenced on Illumina platforms, the smaller average size of the HMS library likely explains the greater numbers of raw paired reads, reads that mapped to the human genome, and unique mapped reads. ",
            "It is also likely that the greater fraction of human DNA recovered from the HMS library (6.57% versus 2.24% in the FBI library) is a direct result of the increased recovery of smaller fragments. ",
            "Due to the extremely degraded state of the endogenous DNA, more of it was likely recovered in the HMS library.",
            "Following the removal of duplicates and reads with low mapping quality scores, Lib1 yielded 1,595,239 reads (1,593,816 nuclear sequences and 1423 mtDNA sequences), while Lib2 yielded 7,691,326 reads (7,687,370 nuclear reads and 3956 mtDNA reads; Table S4). The percentage of mtDNA reads in each of the two libraries was <0.1%, in contrast to the mtDNA capture libraries, where it was 10.9% in Cap-Lib1 and 19.7% in Cap1-Lib2. The average coverage of the mtGenome using shotgun data was too low to produce a full profile. However, when variants could be called (minimum of five reads and a frequency \u226580%), they were in agreement with the profile produced by the hybridization capture data. The average coverage over the entire human genome hg19 was 0.02\u00d7 for Lib1 and 0.09\u00d7 for Lib2.",
            "3.6. Biological Sex Determination",
            "Both RY and RX were first calculated using all reads with Q-scores greater than 30 that aligned to the human genome (Table 3; for mapping details, see Table S5). Since the contamination rate in Lib2 was somewhat high (>11%), RY and RX were also calculated using only reads exhibiting signs of DNA damage (i.e., molecules assumed to be endogenous) (Table 4). For both shotgun libraries (Lib1 and Lib2), the calculated lower bound of the RY confidence interval was >0.075, regardless of whether all reads or only reads showing signs of deamination were used. Values greater than >0.075 point to a male. Similarly, and again regardless of whether or not undamaged molecules were included in the calculations, data from both Lib1 and Lib2 produced an upper bound for the RX confidence interval that was less than 0.6. For this calculation, values less than 0.6 are consistent with a male assignment.",
            "The DNA length distribution of the shotgun data for Lib1 showed a spike at 35 bp, possibly indicative of spurious microbial alignments (Supplementary Figure S3A). Therefore, as an extra precaution, RX and RY were also calculated using only damaged reads >35 bp (467,923 reads). The results were as follows: RX = 0.4369 (95% CI 0.4134\u20130.4603) and RY = 0.0879 (95% CI 0.0827\u20130.093). The male sex assignment remained the same.",

            "4. Discussion",
            "4.1. Origins of the Mummy",
            "For nearly a century, the contents of Tomb 10A have been studied by archaeologists, philologists, and art historians. Based on the styles of pottery, the many wooden sculptures and, of course, the decorations and texts on governor Djehutynakht\u2019s coffins, the tomb has been firmly dated to within a generation between the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th Dynasties (1961\u20132010 BC). The head is clearly original to the tomb. While, for genetic testing purposes, carbon dating of the specimen would have been ideal to further establish its age, additional manipulations were unfortunately impossible, given the value of the head as an object of art. However, several features of both the head and the tomb point clearly to the head originating from one of the original tomb occupants. For one, there is no evidence that the tomb was later reused despite it having been looted in antiquity. No artifacts or tomb contents dating to a later period have been found; in fact, additional human bones found in one of the shafts of Tomb 10A during a more recent 2009 expedition at Deir el-Bersha still support the conclusion that the chamber was used as the resting place for only two individuals. The preparation of the head itself is consistent with the dating of the artifacts in the tomb (1961\u20132010 BC). The head displays rather archaic mummification practices, namely, facial features that were modeled in linen and then painted. This type of treatment was common during the Old Kingdom, but progressively disappeared during the MK. Indeed, the eyes and lips of Djehutynakht\u2019s head were padded and his eyebrows painted (Figure 1). Similar features have been observed in another Deir-el Bersha mummy slightly predating Djehutynakht\u2019s era. The mummy of Henu, recovered from a completely undisturbed late First Intermediate Period (~2100\u20132040 BC) tomb, exhibits the same characteristics regarding facial modeling. As these particular mummification practices did not persist through the MK and later, this feature supports the position that the Tomb 10A head is contemporaneous with the rest of the tomb\u2019s early MK contents. All told, from art history, anthropological, and archaeological perspectives, the facts point to the mummy head belonging to one of the original Tomb 10A occupants: a MK nomarch of the late 11th or early 12th Dynasty or his wife.",
            "4.2. Eurasian mtDNA Haplogroups in Ancient Egyptians",
            "At the time DNA testing was performed on the tooth, and for reasons previously discussed, very little had been published on DNA recovery from ancient Egyptian human remains. Only one publication including HTS and quality control measures was available in early 2016, which described the mtGenome sequencing of an Egyptian mummy from the Greco-Roman period. The individual belonged to mtDNA haplogroup I2. Two other studies describing mtDNA recovery from ancient African samples were also available at the time, but centered on skeletons from more southern regions of the continent. One described the L0d2c1c lineage mtGenome of a 2330-year-old male skeleton from South Africa, while the other described the recovery of a L3x2a mtGenome from the remains of a 4500-year-old individual from Ethiopia. ",
            "Given limited available data and the fact that U5 is the dominant mitochondrial haplogroup found among hunter-gatherers in Europe, the recovery of a haplogroup U5b2b5 sequence from the mummy of Djehutynakht raises the question of data authenticity, despite the molecular metrics suggesting otherwise. When the mummy\u2019s mtDNA sequence is viewed in the context of modern mtDNA diversity, however, the observed U5 lineage could potentially reflect interactions between Egypt and the Near East that date as far back as the Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods. Trade between Egypt and the Near East is evidenced by, among other things, ceramic imports to Egypt. In addition, dwellings similar to those found in Palestine suggest some immigration to Egypt from more arid Near Eastern areas from the late Predynastic to the Old Kingdom. Both trade and immigration between Egypt and the Near East continued to increase over time. Demand in Egypt for cedar of Lebanon wood (a wood available and harvested in Lebanon and Syria during the MK) led to the further establishment of trade routes between Egypt and the Levant. It is interesting, and perhaps not coincidental, that the individual with the mtDNA sequence most similar to Djehutynakht comes from a Lebanese individual.",
            "On top of this historical information offering an explanation for the observed mtDNA data are now additional, recently published, mtGenomes from Africa, and Egypt in particular. MtDNA haplotypes recently obtained from ancient human remains from sub-Saharan Africa belong only to haplogroup L subgroups. However, nearly all of the remains excavated in the Northern part of the continent belong to Eurasian mtDNA lineages. In fact, of the 114 mtDNA genomes now available from northern African ancient human remains, only one belongs to an African lineage (L3 observed in a skeleton from Abusir el-Meleq). The deep presence of Eurasian mtDNA lineages in Northern Africa has, therefore, been clearly established with these recent reports and offers further support for the authenticity of the Eurasian mtDNA sequence observed in the Djehutynakht mummy. In the present study, Near Eastern influence has been found in an individual of high social status who lived in Upper Egypt during the Middle Kingdom. ",
            "4.3. Perspectives for Forensic Laboratories",
            "All currently employed capillary electrophoresis-based human DNA identification methods, as well as recently released commercial HTS assays developed for forensic applications, are based on targeted PCR approaches requiring endogenous DNA fragments, sometimes as small as 70 bp but generally >100 bp. In forensic cases involving the most limited and degraded specimens (e.g., burnt bones, touch DNA, or single hair shafts), the DNA is often too damaged to yield amplicons of that size. Even in those instances for which DNA typing is successful with currently employed technologies, results are generally purposely limited to small regions of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Previous DNA analyses of the Djehutynakht tooth, prior to its receipt by the FBI, are consistent with these trends. Testing performed on the root end of the tooth (Figure 2) between 2009 and 2012 by two different laboratories that used traditional PCR approaches and amplicons as small as 80 bp failed. ",
            "The utility of capture-based and shotgun HTS approaches for these types of difficult samples has been recognized for some time in forensics. A number of studies have demonstrated the utility of HTS in recovering DNA from samples recalcitrant to standard PCR. DNA has been recovered from severely degraded human remains as well as single shed hairs. All work to date, however, has focused exclusively on the mitochondrial genome. The mtDNA results produced here further support the use of HTS techniques for the recovery of accurate and reliable complete mtGenome data from severely degraded specimens, and from capture-based data in particular. However, the data described here also expand on these mtDNA-only approaches by demonstrating the recovery of authentic data from the much more discriminating nuclear genome. ",
            "Nuclear DNA testing in forensics is currently based on autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) loci, and, thus, STRs would be the logical target marker for individual identification purposes. Unfortunately, due to their relatively large size, successful targeted amplification of STRs is rare with highly degraded samples. In addition, STRs are difficult to recover from shotgun data in these types of specimens. Not only is the full length of the repeat region rarely intact, but small recovered fragments of repetitive sequence are also unlikely to include enough genome-specific flanking regions to allow for proper mapping. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), however, can be used for individual identification, and these could be typed using hybridization capture and HTS. SNPs are already being targeted by the ancient DNA community to determine Y haplogroups, assess kinship, and test models of human population history and evolution. For these types of questions, thousands of nuclear SNPs are often targeted, and low coverage of even a subset is generally sufficient to answer the question at hand.",
            "For forensics and other regulated disciplines (e.g., clinical genetics), where questions pertain specifically to individual genetic profiles, strict metrics for profile accuracy and reliability must be met. For example, adequate depth of coverage must be established to ensure SNP genotyping accuracy, and proper analytical thresholds must be set to capture stochasticity in allelic sampling, laboratory processes, and data analysis workflows. These data quality metrics must furthermore be met with time-efficient and cost-effective workflows. Thus, while proof of principle studies in the ancient DNA and, now, forensics disciplines demonstrate recovery of endogenous nuclear DNA from severely compromised specimens, more developmental work is clearly required to enable standard forensic application of these techniques.",
            "CONCL",
            "5. Conclusions",
            "Over the past year, molecular techniques developed and routinely used by the ancient DNA community have finally permitted the recovery of endogenous DNA from ancient Egyptian remains. Here, those techniques were employed to recover the complete mtGenome of the 4000-year-old mummy, Djehutynakht, and to determine that the biological sex was male. Although these approaches have been recently adopted and implemented by the forensic community to develop probative mitochondrial DNA data from the most degraded specimens, further work is needed for the recovery of individually identifiable nuclear DNA markers. Assays will need to be optimized and cost-effective workflows developed to achieve accurate and reliable calls from limited quantities of damaged nuclear DNA. In the meantime, the work described here represents a first step towards further improving forensic DNA testing capabilities in such cases.",

            "Ancient mitogenomes of Phoenicians from Sardinia and Lebanon: A story of settlement, integration, and female mobility",
            "ABSTRACT",
            "The Phoenicians emerged in the Northern Levant around 1800 BCE and by the 9th century BCE had spread their culture across the Mediterranean Basin, establishing trading posts, and settlements in various European Mediterranean and North African locations. Despite their widespread influence, what is known of the Phoenicians comes from what was written about them by the Greeks and Egyptians. In this study, we investigate the extent of Phoenician integration with the Sardinian communities they settled. We present 14 new ancient mitogenome sequences from pre-Phoenician (~1800 BCE) and Phoenician (~700\u2013400 BCE) samples from Lebanon (n = 4) and Sardinia (n = 10) and compare these with 87 new complete mitogenomes from modern Lebanese and 21 recently published pre-Phoenician ancient mitogenomes from Sardinia to investigate the population dynamics of the Phoenician (Punic) site of Monte Sirai, in southern Sardinia. Our results indicate evidence of continuity of some lineages from pre-Phoenician populations suggesting integration of indigenous Sardinians in the Monte Sirai Phoenician community. We also find evidence of the arrival of new, unique mitochondrial lineages, indicating the movement of women from sites in the Near East or North Africa to Sardinia, but also possibly from non-Mediterranean populations and the likely movement of women from Europe to Phoenician sites in Lebanon. Combined, this evidence suggests female mobility and genetic diversity in Phoenician communities, reflecting the inclusive and multicultural nature of Phoenician society.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "The Phoenicians, one of the great ancient civilizations, brought together East and West; they linked Asia, Europe and Africa through their trade networks and settlements, and they created the ancestral alphabet to most of the Western world today. They were skilled navigators whose trade networks extended throughout the entire Mediterranean basin, and they had taken an Egyptian-sponsored circumnavigation of Africa long before the Vikings ventured out of the sight of land. From their homeland in what is today Lebanon, the Phoenicians sailed extensively across the Mediterranean for trade and established settlements in Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Ibiza, the Iberian Peninsula and along the North African coast, most notably, Carthage (Fig 1). Their naval dominance was respected throughout the Mediterranean, and they provided maritime support to the Persians and the Egyptians.",
            "Despite their enduring influence, scant historical documentation attributed directly to the Phoenicians exists. Most of the Phoenician historic documents were written on papyrus, and have not survived or been discovered yet. What we do know of them is what others, the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians wrote about them. They were never a unified political state or distinct ethnicity within their homeland. The emerging coastal city-states of Byblos and Sidon thrived as maritime trade centers during the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE and later, the city of Tyre. During the 1st millennium BCE their occupants were referred to by the Greeks, and thus today, as the Phoenicians (from the Greek, Phoin\u00edk\u0113, or purple country) in reference to their production of the valuable purple dye used in textile production. Prior to this, however, the region was occupied by Canaanites who, due to political events in the north, south and east, were confined to the thin coastal strip between the steep, cedar covered mountains of Lebanon and the eastern Mediterranean. This coastal isolation meant that Phoenicians could only expand westwards, and this they did. Targeting sources of valuable metals including silver and tin, they established settlements across the Mediterranean and dominated maritime trade networks for centuries.",
            "Starting in the middle of 8th century BCE the Assyrians waged war on the Phoenicians and soon after they brought them under their yoke. With the decline of Phoenician influence in the east, Carthage, a city that was settled by Phoenicians fleeing Tyre in 813 BCE, became the centre of western Phoenician, or Punic, dominance until its destruction in 146 BCE by the Romans in the 3rd Punic War. Carthage, like many of the early Phoenician cities around the Mediterranean, adopted many of the rituals and features of their homeland.",
            "The island of Sardinia, like Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, and Ibiza, was a significant location in the early Phoenician trade routes to the Iberian and North African coasts, and later in the Punic interaction sphere. Phoenician settlements were established primarily along the south and west coast of Sardinia, with two of the earliest located at Sulcis and, slightly inland, Monte Sirai. As was common in Phoenician Sardinia, Monte Sirai was built next to previous Nuragic tower used by the first inhabitants like a shrine. The necropolis at Monte Sirai was one of the largest Punic burial sites in Sardinia and was used between the end of 7th and the first half of 4th century BCE. This period of use coincides with the Carthaginian dominion in Sardinia (starting at the end of 6th century BCE).",
            "Genetic research on modern populations in Lebanon and the Levant, the homeland of the Phoenicians, shows that much of the genetic structure of the region today is influenced by historic migrations associated with the spread of major religions\u2013Christians, Muslims and Druze. Research on the Y chromosome DNA of men currently living in locations of historic Phoenician influence from across the Mediterranean, compared with men from nearby locations with no evidence of Phoenician contact, has identified likely Phoenician Y chromosome markers. These markers were present in more than 6% of the men living in Phoenician-influenced locations around the Mediterranean and in more than 30% of Lebanese men. Comparative analyses of uniparental genetic markers in modern Lebanese indicate different genetic histories between males and females, with significantly more European lineages evident in the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than observed for the paternally inherited Y chromosome. When these European-derived lineages were integrated into the Lebanese population is not yet fully resolved. If identified, mitochondrial markers associated with Phoenician settlement around the Mediterranean may help document the movement of women within the Phoenician networks. They can also be used to indicate how much integration with indigenous inhabitants occurred in Phoenician settlements. We now have the opportunity to investigate the genetic and cultural history of the Phoenicians and their spread across the Mediterranean through the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) from skeletal remains recovered from pre-Phoenician, Phoenician and Punic archaeological sites across the Mediterranean.",
            "Here we describe the results of analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes of ancient samples recovered from three Phoenician sites in Lebanon and Sardinia and one slightly earlier Middle Bronze Age site in Lebanon. We compare these results to modern mitochondrial genome data from Lebanese populations and recently published, pre-Phoenician ancient Sardinian mitogenome data to identify possible Phoenician/Punic-introduced mitochondrial haplotypes and attempt to reconstruct the history of interactions and the Phoenician genetic influence on modern population diversity.",

            "A total of 28 ancient tooth samples were obtained for aDNA analyses from four archaeological sites in Lebanon, BEY 197, BEY 198, Saifi 477, and Tell Fadous-Kfarabida, and one site, Monte Sirai, in Sardinia. Permits and approval for this study were obtained from the office of the Director General of Antiquities in Lebanon (permit number 4290, 6 November 2015) for all Lebanese samples and from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (prot. No. 5844, 17 March 2016), Superintendent of Archaeology in Cagliari) for the Monte Sirai samples. The Sardinian samples are held in the laboratory of archaeology \"Sabatino Moscati\" located at the Segni's Palace, University of Sassari, and the Lebanese samples are stored with the Directorate General of Antiquities, in Beirut, Lebanon.",
            "Two closely related sites, BEY 197 and BEY 198, were excavated in 2012 and 2013, and are located at the center of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. The archaeological context of the samples we studied from BEY 198 relates to the late Phoenician, Achaemenid period (539\u2013330 BCE). In addition to the stratigraphy, a pilgrim flask, a dish, a pitcher, a gold ring and red carnelian beads were found in the tomb, enabling accurate dating of this archaeological context. This tomb, heavily demolished during construction works in the 2nd century BCE, contains skeletal remains belonging to several individuals, most probably four persons, including one adolescent and a child. The remains were found in a funerary chamber dug in the rock. The excavated grave in BEY 197 is an inhumation burial found in a high state of fragmentation with extensive penetrating erosion. The single skeleton was laid inside a rectangular cut (pit) in bedrock with an (E-W) orientation and was covered by a yellowish-reddish, compact to weakly cemented, cobble/sand fill. The provisional dating assigned to this grave ranges between the 4th and the 1st century BCE.",
            "The Saifi 477 site is also located in Beirut and was excavated between 2013 and 2014. The skeletal remains in this site were found in pits excavated in the geological substrate. Pits containing children and not adults were lined and covered with pebbles. The deceased were placed on their backs and their limbs were in an extended position. Two of the skeletons from which our samples were obtained were accompanied with funeral material: an adult wore a thick copper alloy bracelet around the right leg and a child with a copper alloy bracelet around each ankle. All these burial rituals are consistent with a 5th\u20144th century BCE date.",
            "The fourth site in Lebanon was at Tell Fadous-Kfarabida, a town situated 2 km south of the coastal town of Batroun, and revealed the presence of three Middle Bronze Age tombs. Excavations on this site started in 2007 and the skeletal remains for this study were unearthed between 2007 to 2010. The pottery from the three tombs is quite homogeneous and can be dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age I (~1800 BCE). This dating is also supported by a scarab found with one of the burials which dates to the late 12th to 13th Egyptian Middle Kingdom Dynasty.",
            "The archaeological site of Monte Sirai is a hill-top settlement located in Carbonia, south-western Sardinia, Italy. The site is comprised of three large sectors: the main sector of the settlement, the \u201cacropolis\u201d, located in the southern portion of the hill; the sacred place, or \u201ctophet\u201d, located in the northern portion of the site, and the large necropolis located in the valley separating the settlement from the tophet (S1 Fig). Archaeological evidence indicates that Monte Sirai was founded by Phoenicians in the last quarter of 8th century BCE, and totally abandoned during the 1st century BCE. The necropolis contained several tomb types including inhumations of single and multiple individuals, primary cremations, enchytrismoi (child burials in transport amphorae) and semi-combustions. The first excavations of the site were carried out in the 1960s, and again in the 1980s, though systematic excavations, involving a large graveyard area, began in 2005 and are on-going. Samples were obtained during the 2015 field season from a range of burial contexts including three single pit burials; one jar burial; and two group burials, one containing four, and the other, two individuals, all dating from the period between the end of 6th and the first decades of 4th century BCE.",

Specifically, ancient sequences were subjected to AdapterRemoval, where sequencing adaptors, reads with stretches of Ns, bases with quality scores of <30 and short reads (<25 bp) were removed. Additionally, where paired end fragments overlapped by at least 11 base pairs, reads were merged. Merged and unmerged reads were aligned separately with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) using recommended ancient DNA settings in which seeding was disabled (-l 1024), gap opens was set to 2 (-o 2) and maximum edit distance was set to 0.03 (-n0.03). To test for contamination with laboratory reagents, all reads were mapped to a composite reference genome constructed using the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) for humans, along with the reference mitochondrial genomes for cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa) and chicken (Gallus gallus) (GenBank refs NC_006853, NC_0012095.1 and NC_001323.1).

            "From the 16 ancient Lebanese samples processed, a total of four complete ancient mitogenomes from three archaeological sites were considered acceptable in terms of their coverage (at least 3x), and showing appropriate damage patterns and no significant level of contamination, resulting in a success rate of 25%. From Monte Sirai, Sardinia, 10 complete mitogenomes were generated from the 12 samples processed, resulting in a success rate of 83%. This difference in success rates between the two regions is likely related to several factors impacting DNA preservation including temperature, humidity and post-excavation treatment. Of the four Lebanese samples for which we were able to obtain acceptable full mitogenomes, one was from Tel Fadous-Kfarabida, one from BEY 197 and two were from BEY 198. All three of these sites were excavated in the last decade. The Lebanese samples were not washed in the field or lab, but they were not collected or stored specifically with the intention of future aDNA analyses. The soils from the Saifi site appeared to be moist, which may explain the poor results (0/4) from that site. Previous attempts to recover aDNA results from samples from a wet part of site BEY 198 (next to a well) were all unsuccessful (unpublished data). The Monte Sirai samples were all recently (2015) excavated and collected with the expressed purpose of aDNA analysis. Most of the graves were pits dug into the tuff (natural rock soil) that were closed, covered by stone slabs, and one sample, MS10584, was from a jar burial (enchytrismoi). These features may have provided protection from the elements resulting in better DNA preservation.",

Sardinian samples had a much wider range of coverage (range of mean coverage was 4.8 to 1321.2, while the range for Lebanese samples was 4.8 to 49.8). However, the amplicon length between the two groups was not significantly different (Welch two-sample t-test, t = 0.05, df = 5.42, p = 0.96) (S3 Fig).

Populations that diverged from one-another carry uniparental lineages that accumulate mutations randomly, yielding increasing genetic distances between those populations. The induced geographic correlation with genetic distance will be visible using median-joining network techniques, and in the distance information contained in the ancestrally-informative components in the singular value decomposition of SNP data. Interpretation is subject to the caveat that principal component analysis identifies any leading alignments marking the largest distances among samples; connection to migrations requires care. Statistics measuring the discriminating power of principal components between populations, such as DAPC, serve to test the isolation between populations. The strongest signals differentiating these populations will tend to be the oldest, since these yield the largest genetic differences.",

            "The Median-Joining network incorporating all of our ancient mitogenomes from Sardinia and Lebanon with the pre-Phoenician Sardinian data from Olivieri, and the results of the DAPC analyses of these same samples are shown in Fig 2. We only found one haplotype (H3) shared between pre-Phoenician and Phoenician era samples from Sardinia and this can be seen in the network analysis (Fig 2A). However, we do not find many mutations separating haplotypes from all the three groups, particularly those in haplogroup H. Two clades (the K1 and U5 haplogroups) contain samples from pre-Phoenician Sardinians only, whereas the W5, N1b1a5 and X2b clades contain only Phoenician Sardinians, and appear to be distant from any pre-Phoenician Sardinian samples and thus we suggest that these are likely Phoenician samples. The T2b3 sample from Beirut is only two mutations removed from a pre-Phoenician Sardinian sample and does not appear to be an indigenous Lebanese lineage but rather a foreign introduction to the Beirut Phoenician population. We carried out DAPC analyses to investigate genetic structuring within our sampling. DAPC performs discriminant analyses (DA) on principle components (PC). Generally, DA resolves between population relationships while ignoring within population variation. DAPC uses PCA to resolve within population variation and then performs a DA to resolve between population structure. The two DAPC plots (one discriminant function and two discriminant functions) support the pattern found in the network analysis, identifying overlapping signatures of Lebanese samples with the Sardinian Phoenicians, with a clear pre-Phoenician component of the population (Fig 2B and 2C). We see that most Phoenician-era samples cluster closely together with pre-Phoenician samples.",
            "Four of the haplotypes identified in our ancient Phoenician samples stand out as being possible candidates for Phoenician introductions as they appear to be foreign when compared to both modern and ancient data from the location in which they were found. The ML trees for haplogroups N1b1, W5, X2, which were found in our Phoenician samples from Monte Sirai, and T2b3 which appears to be a foreign introduction to the BEY 197 site in Lebanon, are shown in Fig 3. The most appropriate nucleotide substitution model was determined to be HKY for haplogroups N1b1, W5 and T2b3 and TrN for the X2 haplogroup.",
            "Archaeological context and relatedness of group burials in Monte Sirai",
            "The archaeological interpretation of the group burials in Monte Sirai is that they could represent family burials. We found that one group burial, containing four individuals, included two 6 to 12-year-olds who had near-identical J1c haplotypes (see S3 Table). MS10579 and MS10580 were identified as J1c with SNPs at positions 16261 and 189. They also shared two novel mutations, 310.1C and 7154G. The remaining differences between these two haplotypes are four C to T transitions in sample MS10579, which are very likely to be the result of damage, and two missing SNPs which are due to reduced coverage in this region. It is therefore possible that these two were indeed siblings or otherwise maternally related, for example, cousins. The other two burials in that group had the two non-local lineages: another 6 to 12-year-old with the N1b1a5 and a young adult female, 16 to 22 years of age, with the W5 haplotype. While this indicates that there is not a maternal connection between these four individuals who were buried together, it is possible that they are family members related through paternal connections. The other group burial contained two individuals, an 8 to 14-year-old with an X2b haplotype and a young adult male with an H1bn mitogenome. Analyses of more burials from Monte Sirai and possible extended analyses of Y chromosome or autosomal data are necessary to further test the relatedness of individuals buried in Monte Sirai.",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "The aim of the study was to seek mitochondrial DNA markers recovered from ancient samples that can be associated with Phoenician origins and ancestry, enabling us to track Phoenician mobility and genetic impacts of settlement, in this case, in Sardinia. We collected ancient samples from documented Middle Bronze Age and Phoenician burials in Lebanon, and from Monte Sirai, Sardinia, one of the largest Phoenician-Punic necropoli in the central Mediterranean.",
            "Without ancient DNA, a Phoenician introduced signature can be difficult to distinguish from earlier Near Eastern lineages that spread during the Neolithic expansion to European sites that were later colonized by the Phoenicians, like Monte Sirai. It is expected however, that Neolithic expansions would spread lineages broadly across the landscape, where Phoenician signatures are likely to be restricted to locations of well-established Phoenician contact. Due to the relative isolation of Sardinia and the unusual genetic signature of its population, modern Sardinians are often presented as the best representation of the early Neolithic population that expanded from the Near East into Southern Europe. The recent study of Olivieri et al., which provides mitogenomes for 21 ancient samples and over 2000 new modern Sardinian samples, identifies numerous Sardinian-specific haplogroups including a few lineages they argue are likely indicative of pre-Neolithic settlement of the island. Their ancient samples date to between 6000 and 3000 years calBP and thus provide a valuable snapshot of the pre-Phoenician population of Sardinia.",
            "While the later Phoenician influence in Sardinia was likely via Carthage, as indicated by the archaeological evidence from Monte Sirai, we still might expect to see the appearance of new Near Eastern and/or North African mitochondrial lineages in the burials from the site given that Carthage was settled directly from Tyre. The appearance of Phoenician introduced markers in Sardinia might also be inferred by analyses of the estimated TMRCAs of shared haplogroups in modern populations in Lebanon and Sardinia that potentially differentiate them from older Neolithic signatures spread throughout Europe.",
            "Haplogroup H",
            "The most common haplogroup seen in our ancient Lebanese and Sardinian samples was the superhaplogroup H, identified in 7 of 14 samples (50%). Two of the four ancient Lebanese samples belong to haplogroup H (sub-groups H and H34) and a third belongs to the sister clade, R0. Five of the Monte Sirai samples (50%) were identified as having H haplotypes (H+16311, H1e1a6, H1bn, H3, and H5d). Haplogroups H1, H3 and H5 are all thought to have a Southwest European origin and to have spread from there after the LGM. There were no shared haplotypes between the ancient samples of Lebanon and those from Monte Sirai. However, all sequences belonging to haplogroups H and R0 (ancient samples of Lebanon and Sardinia, and Monte Sirai) are very closely related as they are separated by only few mutations (Fig 2A). Olivieri et al. also report high levels of H subgroups in their ancient samples (38%) with several closely related lineages to our Monte Sirai samples (HV0j1, H1, H1e1, H1e1a, H3, H3u and H5a).",
            "In modern populations, the frequencies of haplogroup H range between 40\u201350% in Europe and about 20% in Southwest Asia. Subclades H1 and H3, the major subclades of this haplogroup, are almost exclusively European with limited penetration of H1 in the Near East, suggesting a European origin with estimated ages of 14Ky-16Ky and 9Ky-11Ky respectively. Haplogroups H1 and H3 are the most common found in modern Sardinians, with several Sardinian specific lineages recently identified. No H3 lineages were found in our ancient or modern Lebanese samples. Its presence in Sardinia in ancient samples (both pre-Phoenician and Phoenician), combined with the diversity seen in the modern Sardinian population is consistent with at least a Neolithic introduction to the island if not pre-Neolithic. Haplogroup HV is also an ancient European lineage, likely originating in the Mediterranean region during the LGM and has been identified in early Neolithic remains from Spain. However, to date, most studies on haplogroup H and its subgroups reveal a very complex tree structure and more mitogenome data is needed before any conclusion can be made with certainty about the origin and date of the H subgroups.",
            "Haplogroup J1c",
            "Two samples from Monte Sirai (MS10579 and MS10580) have J1c haplotypes with the addition of two previously identified mutations at positions 189 and 16261 and a unique mutation at 7154. This full motif was not found in any of our modern Lebanese samples, though we did find a J1c with the 16261 mutation, and one J1c11a haplotype. Several J1c sub-types are seen in modern Sardinians and a J1c3 was identified in one pre-Phoenician sample dating to around 4000 BCE. Haplogroup J is thought to have arisen in West Asia sometime around 45 Ky Pala et al. suggest that during the LGM, haplogroup J sub-groups arose in the Near Eastern refugia, though since J1c is rare in the Near East today, it may have first emerged in southeast Europe. A J2b1 haplogroup was recently identified in an early Mesolithic (8227\u20137596 BCE) sample from Sardinia. J1c has not yet been found in any ancient Mesolithic samples in Europe, but Mathieson et al. have reported J1c haplotypes in samples from Turkey, Hungary and Germany dating from 4000 BCE and in Spain from 2000 BCE. Allentoft et al. found a J1c1b in a Bronze Age sample from Italy. It is clear that J1c was present in Sardinia prior to the arrival of Phoenicians, and possibly prior to Neolithic expansions.",
            "Haplogroup N1b1a5",
            "The presence of one sample from Monte Sirai, MS10578, a 6 to 12-year-old child that has an N1b1a5 haplotype is of particular interest. Haplogroup N lineages are rare in modern Sardinians. Recently, however, four individuals were identified carrying haplogroup N1b1a9, which appears to be a Sardinian specific haplogroup. The coalescence ages of this haplogroup are estimated to be 7.3\u20139.4 Ky, so this may have been a pre-Neolithic introduction to the island. N1b1a5, however, is more recent (Olivieri et al. Fig 3), dating to 2.5 Ky, which aligns nicely with a Phoenician/Punic introduction. Brandt et al. suggest that N is a marker of Western European Hunter Gatherers as it has been found in Mesolithic samples from Portugal and a Palaeolithic sample in Southern Italy. Ancient samples with haplogroup N1a have been found in early Neolithic sites from Spain and Germany, but N1b has not been recorded in Neolithic samples outside of the Levant with two exceptions from Anatolia dating to 6500\u20136200 BCE and between 7500\u20135800 calBCE. N1b is a relatively common haplogroup in Lebanon, with 9 of the 87 (10%) modern samples we sequenced carrying N1b1a subtypes. While we have not found any N1b in our ancient Lebanese samples, it is not unlikely that this haplogroup was introduced to Sardinia via Phoenician contact, either directly from the Levant or via Phoenician/Punic settlements in North Africa, for example Carthage. Fig 3A shows that N1b1a lineages have been identified in modern Tunisians and in a modern Moroccan, as well as in a modern individual from Sicily, another island with known Phoenician settlement.",
            "Haplogroup W5",
            "Haplogroup W is thought to have evolved during the LGM around the Caspian Sea region. Its oldest subgroup, W1 has been found in one individual from the Neolithic site of Barc\u0131n, in Anatolia dating to 6500\u20136200 BCE. Haplogroups W1, W3 and W6 have been found in late Neolithic and early Bronze Age sites in Germany and Russia and W1 has been identified in a Neolithic sample from the Iberian Peninsula. W5 has yet to be identified in Mesolithic or Neolithic remains in Europe or in any ancient samples from the Levant. While haplogroups W1, W3 and W10 are present in modern Sardinians, the archaeological sample from Monte Sirai, MS10581, a young female included in a group burial, is, as far as we know, the first W5 identified in Sardinia. The age of W5 has been estimated to be 12.2 Ky, and while W5 is most commonly found in Northern Central Europe and Britain today (Fig 3B), a basal W5 lineage was identified in a Moroccan Berber, which clusters most closely with our Phoenician sample. Our ancient result from Monte Sirai is indeed significant and establishes a minimum date of late 5th century BCE for haplogroup W5 in the Mediterranean region and, given the Phoenician trade networks, could explain the presence of W5 in North Africa. It is possible that haplogroup W5 got into the Mediterranean via the Phoenician tin trade with Britain or Ireland, though only further aDNA work can confirm this hypothesis.",

            "Sample MS10587 from Monte Sirai belonged to haplogroup X2b, with an extra mutation at position 226C. Mathiesen et al. report this same signature in a sample (I1499) from Garadna, Hungary dating to 5210\u20135010 calBCE (see S5 Fig). X2b has also been recorded in an early Neolithic sample from Revenia, Greece, dated to 6438\u20136264 calBCE. Haplogroup X is relatively rare in Europe, generally found at frequencies of less than 1%. The highest frequencies of X in Europe are reported in Catalonia, the Pyrenees and southern Portugal, at about 2.5%. It is found at relatively high frequencies in Druze from the Levant, where it reaches frequencies of up to 15%, including subtype X2b (Fig 3C), though we did not identify X haplotypes in any of our modern Lebanese samples. It is possible that X2b was a Phoenician haplogroup introduced to Sardinia either directly from Lebanon or via North Africa, though an earlier, early Neolithic introduction, perhaps via a maritime route cannot be rejected. However, haplogroup X was not found in any of the 21 ancient Sardinian samples reported by Olivieri et al..",
            "Haplogroup T2b3",
            "Sample MS10560, from BEY 197, was identified as a T2b3 with an additional mutation at position 151. T2b is a haplogroup that we did not identify in any of the modern Lebanese we sequenced though T2 is found at low frequencies there today and was identified in one of our modern Lebanese samples. Haplogroup T2 is currently found at around 10% frequency in northern and central Europe, though some of the highest rates are in Sardinia, southern Portugal and pockets in northern Spain. T2b is the most common T2 subgroup found in Europe today and it has been identified in ancient samples from the LBK in central Europe. Haplogroup T2c is reported in an early Neolithic sample (5295\u20135066 calBCE) from the Els Trocs site in the Pyrenees. There has been some debate regarding the origins of the T2 lineages, which were originally thought to have had a Near East origin and spread into Europe with Neolithic expansions. To date, in the ancient Near East, T2b has only been identified in two Neolithic samples from north-western Anatolia, dated to around 6500BCE. It has not been found in 45 samples tested from Israel, Jordan and Iran, dating from the Natufian through the Early Bronze Age or in 15 Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) samples from Syria, or 9 PPN samples from central Anatolia. It is possible that the origins of T2 and in particular T2b may indeed be in southern Central Europe in the LGM, as suggested by Pala et al..",
            "Finally, the presence of a T2b3 haplotype in an ancient sample from Lebanon is unusual, as it does not appear to be an indigenous lineage. The tomb in which the burial was found was not marked and did not have any of the artefacts found in site 198, suggesting different burial customs. This is further evidence suggesting that this individual belonged to a different socioeconomic class or ethnic group, perhaps a slave brought to Beirut from one of the Phoenician settlements. Of particular interest is the reporting of a T2b3 with the 151 mutation (plus one more mutation at position 9926) in an ancient sample (KY399146) reported by Olivieri et al. dating to 3086 \u00b1 85 calBP from Cagliari, Sardinia. Cagliari was the site of another significant Phoenician colony, Karaly. Our ancient Beirut sample is most closely related to modern samples from Tunisia (Fig 3D), again, possibly indicating movement of women through the Phoenician networks from European colonies and trading ports to Phoenician cities in the homeland and Carthage.",
            "Integration of indigenous Sardinians in the Phoenician/Punic society of Monte Sirai",
            "Olivieri et al. suggest that their analyses of Sardinian-Specific Haplogroups and ancient mitogenomes dating to between 6000 and 3000 years ago may indicate that the earliest inhabitants of the island arrived prior to the Neolithic expansion into the region, which is consistent with archaeological and Y-chromosome data suggesting earlier settlement. In particular, they identify haplogroups K1a2d and U5b1i1 as likely Mesolithic arrivals in Sardinia, but also raise the possibility that several H1 and H3 subgroups found in modern Sardinians are pre-Neolithic. While we found several H lineages in our ancient Phoenicians, including a shared H3 haplotype with an ancient pre-Phoenician Sardinian sample, we found no evidence of K1 or U5 lineages in the Monte Sirai samples. Recent analyses of 3514 whole-genome sequences of modern Sardinians suggest pre-Neolithic occupation of the island and that some of the populations, particularly those in the mountainous central eastern (Gennargentu) region of the island, carry higher levels of this hunter-gatherer DNA compared to populations from more accessible regions. Our result, finding no K1 or U5 mitochondrial lineages in Monte Sirai, may be indicative of early social and/or geographic isolation of those hunter-gatherer populations.",
            "The proposed Phoenician lineages, W5, N1b1a5 and X2b are not found in Sardinians today, suggesting rare introductions, of the nature of single individuals rather than as representative of major colonizing groups. We suggest that N1b1a5 could be an introduction from Carthage or some other North African location within the Phoenician network. It is therefore interesting that Chiang et al. do find evidence in the whole-genome data of a small degree of what they suggest may be either sub-Saharan ancestry or North African ancestry prior to the Arab expansions, which they indicate could indeed be related to Phoenician contact.",
            "CONCL",
            "Conclusions",
            "Our analyses of ancient pre-Phoenician and Phoenician mitogenomes from Lebanon and Sardinia provide important clues on cultural expansion, assimilation and population mobility in the Mediterranean between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE. First, we see a certain degree of continuity of population ancestry between Phoenician and pre-Phoenician populations in Sardinia, which is consistent with archaeological evidence of integration between the cultures. However, our data from Monte Sirai, combined with our previously published result identifying a European mitochondrial haplogroup, U5b2c1, in a young man buried in a Phoenician crypt in Carthage, North Africa, provide evidence of several instances of unexpected, non-indigenous mitochondrial haplotypes in Phoenician burials both in and outside the homeland of Lebanon. These include the T2b3 haplotype in the BEY 197 site, Beirut, Lebanon, and the Near Eastern N1b1a5 and a northern European W5 found in Monte Sirai, Sardinia. Sardinia has been the subject of numerous genetic studies due to its important geographic isolation. The Sardinian population is often described as the best representation of early farmer ancestry, and indeed, we do see the likely early farmer mtDNA lineages combined with those of the Southwestern/Central Mediterranean Mesolithic (particularly haplogroups H and possibly H1, H3 and H5), in the Phoenician samples at Monte Sirai. Brandt et al. highlight the need for more aDNA complete mitogenomes to interpret the variation within Haplogroup H in the past and to assign specific subtypes to particular regions and time periods. The seven ancient Phoenician H samples identified here can help contribute to that goal. However, we also see haplogroups that indicate other influences in the population history of Sardinia, with the appearance of N1b1a5 and W5, which have not yet been recorded in modern Sardinian populations. These two haplogroups and possibly X2b, we suggest, are examples of Phoenician introductions to Sardinia, not only from the Phoenician homeland or via Punic settlements in North Africa, but may represent the mobility of women through the wider Phoenician trade networks.",
            "While previous Y chromosome analyses of modern populations around the Mediterranean demonstrated the impact of Phoenician males on the genetic makeup of many communities, we now see that it is likely that the Phoenician trade networks or settlements strategies also included the translocation of women throughout the region as well as the assimilation of indigenous women in Phoenician settlements. Analyses of genetic variation in modern Lebanese populations suggest closer affiliations with Europe based on mitochondrial lineages. Our result, identifying the European lineage T2b3 in the BEY197 site, suggests that some of those European mtDNA lineages could be associated with the integration of European women in Phoenician communities in Lebanon.",
            "Finally, numerous studies published in the last five years highlight the importance of aDNA studies in understanding population change through time, though most of these have focused on the Neolithic transition. While these studies tell a story of significant population replacement in Europe with the arrival of farmers, analyses of later historic burials associated with Roman Britain, for example, and now our data from Phoenician sites, demonstrate that both migration and cultural assimilation were common, resulting in surprisingly cosmopolitan communities in the past.",

            "ABSTRACT",
            "While the series of events that shaped the transition between foraging societies and food producers are well described for Central and Southern Europe, genetic evidence from Northern Europe surrounding the Baltic Sea is still sparse. Here, we report genome-wide DNA data from 38 ancient North Europeans ranging from ~9500 to 2200 years before present. Our analysis provides genetic evidence that hunter-gatherers settled Scandinavia via two routes. We reveal that the first Scandinavian farmers derive their ancestry from Anatolia 1000 years earlier than previously demonstrated. The range of Mesolithic Western hunter-gatherers extended to the east of the Baltic Sea, where these populations persisted without gene-flow from Central European farmers during the Early and Middle Neolithic. The arrival of steppe pastoralists in the Late Neolithic introduced a major shift in economy and mediated the spread of a new ancestry associated with the Corded Ware Complex in Northern Europe.",
            "The population history of Europe is complex and its very north has not yet been comprehensively studied at a genetic level. Here, Mittnik et al. report genome-wide data from 38 ancient individuals from the Eastern Baltic, Russia and Scandinavia to analyse gene flow throughout the Mesolithic and Bronze Age.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "Recent studies of ancient human genomes have revealed a complex population history of modern Europeans involving at least three major prehistoric migrations, influenced by climatic conditions, the availability of resources, the spread of technological and cultural innovations, and possibly diseases. However, the archaeological record of the very north of the European subcontinent surrounding today\u2019s Baltic Sea shows a history distinct to that of Central and Southern Europe which has not yet been comprehensively studied on a genomic level.",
            "Settlement of the Eastern Baltic and Scandinavia by mobile foragers started after the retreat of the glacial ice sheets around 11,000 years before present. To the west and south, hunter-gatherers sharing a common genetic signature (Western Hunter-Gatherers or WHG; Supplementary Note\u00a01 provides a glossary of abbreviations and archaeological terms) already occupied wide ranges of Europe for several millennia. From further to the east, in the territory of today\u2019s Russia, remains of Mesolithic foragers have been studied (Eastern Hunter-Gatherers or EHG). They derived part of their ancestry, referred to as Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) ancestry, from a population related to the Upper Palaeolithic Mal\u2019ta boy found in Siberia (MA1). Late Mesolithic foragers excavated in central Sweden, which have been called Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHG), were modelled as admixed between WHG and EHG. Archaeological evidence for the settlement of Scandinavia suggests both a route through southern Scandinavia and a route along the northern coast of Fennoscandia. Foraging groups that inhabited the eastern coast and larger islands of the Baltic Sea as well as the Eastern Baltic inland during the 8th and 7th millennium calibrated radiocarbon years before Common Era (calBCE) developed a dual habitation system, establishing more permanent settlements than their surrounding contemporaries while remaining partially mobile.",
            "The following Early Neolithic period, starting around 6000 calBCE, saw the transition from foraging to a sedentary agricultural lifestyle with the expansion of farmers out of Anatolia into Central and Southern Europe. This development reached southern Scandinavia at around 4000 calBCE with farmers of the so-called Early Neolithic Funnel Beaker Culture (EN TRB; from German Trichterbecher) who gradually introduced cultivation of cereals and cattle rearing. At the transition to the northern Middle Neolithic, around 3300 calBCE, an intensification of agriculture occurred in Denmark and in western central Sweden accompanied by the erection of megaliths. Settlements in eastern central Sweden increasingly concentrated along the coast, where the economy shifted towards the marine resources. Early pottery of these coastal hunter-gatherers, known as the Pitted Ware Culture (PWC), resembles the Funnel beakers in shape. Analysis of ancient genomes from PWC and megalithic Middle Neolithic TRB (MN TRB) context in central Sweden has shown that the PWC individuals retain the genetic signature of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers while the TRB farmers\u2019 ancestry can mainly be traced back to Central European farmers, albeit with substantial admixture from European hunter-gatherers. As these TRB individuals date to a period one millennium after the initial Neolithization in southern Scandinavia, the question remains whether the first introduction of farming around 4000 BCE was driven by newcomers or by local groups involving later gene-flow from Central European farmers.",
            "The production and use of pottery, in Central and Southern Europe often seen as part of the \u2018Neolithic package\u2019, was already common among foragers in Scandinavia during the preceding Mesolithic Erteb\u00f8lle phase. Similarly, in the Eastern Baltic, where foraging continued to be the main form of subsistence until at least 4000 calBCE, ceramics technology was adopted before agriculture, as seen in the Narva Culture and Combed Ceramic Culture (CCC). Recent genome-wide data of Baltic pottery-producing hunter-gatherers revealed genetic continuity with the preceding Mesolithic inhabitants of the same region as well as influence from the more northern EHG, but did not reveal conclusively whether there was a temporal, geographical or cultural correlation with the affinity to either WHG or EHG.",
            "The transition from the Late (Final) Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age (LNBA) is seen as a major transformative period in European prehistory, accompanied by changes in burial customs, technology and mode of subsistence as well as the creation of new cross-continental networks of contact seen in the emergence of the pan-European Corded Ware Complex (CWC, ca. 2900\u20132300 calBCE) in Central and north-eastern Europe. Studies of ancient genomes have shown that those associated with the CWC were closely related to the pastoralists of the Yamnaya Culture from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, introducing a genetic component that was not present in Europe previously. This genetic component is hypothesized to have spread in the subsequent millennia throughout Europe and can be seen in today\u2019s European populations in a decreasing north-east to south-west gradient.",
            "Intriguingly, modern Eastern Baltic populations carry the highest proportion of WHG ancestry of all Europeans, supporting the theory that the hunter-gatherer population of this region left a lasting genetic impact on subsequent populations.",
            "Here, we investigate the modes of cultural and economic transitions experienced by the prehistoric populations surrounding the Baltic Sea. Were the changes seen in the Eastern Baltic Neolithic, which did not involve the introduction of agriculture, driven by contact with neighbouring groups and if so can we identify these? Was the earliest practice of farming in southern Scandinavia a development by a local population or did it involve migration from the South? How did the unique genetic signature of modern Eastern Baltic populations come to be?",
            "We present novel genome-wide data from 38 ancient individuals from the Eastern Baltic, Russia and Sweden spanning 7000 years of prehistory, covering the transition from a mobile hunter-gatherer to a sedentary agricultural lifestyle, as well as the adoption of bronze metallurgy. We show that the settlement of Scandinavia by hunter-gatherers likely took place via at least two routes, and that the first introduction of farming was brought about by the movement of the Central European farmers into the region at around 4000 calBCE. In the Eastern Baltics, foraging remained the dominant economy among interconnected north-eastern hunter-gatherer groups that did not experience admixture from European farmers until around 3000 calBCE, when a shift towards agro-pastoralism came about through migrations from the Pontic-Caspian steppe.",

            "Samples and archaeological background",
            "The skeletal remains studied here were recovered from 25 archaeological sites in the territory of modern Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Archangelsk Oblast\u00a0and Karelia (north-western Russia) and Sweden dating from around 7500 to 200 calBCE (Fig.\u00a01, Supplementary Note\u00a02, Supplementary Data\u00a01). In total, we analyzed DNA from 106 human remains. A total of 41 samples with good DNA preservation were selected for deeper shotgun sequencing or SNP capture (Supplementary Data\u00a01). In the latter case, we enriched samples for a panel of around 1.24 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) via in-solution capture. After quality control, genome-wide data from 38 individuals, with an average coverage of 0.02\u20138.8-fold on targeted SNPs, were included in further analysis.",
            "The 38 final samples fall into nine broad groups (Table\u00a01): first, two Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from north-western Russia (ca. 7500\u20135000 calBCE); secondly, an individual (5720\u20135560 calBCE) from the lake burial site of Motala, Sweden, adding to the previously published six SHG individuals from this site; two Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Lithuania (ca. 6440\u20135740 calBCE) associated with the Kunda Culture (referred to as Baltic Mesolithic), whose archaeological assemblages found in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and adjacent parts of Russia.",
            "Twelve individuals were associated with pottery-producing forager cultures. Ten of them from Lithuania and Estonia (ca. 5460\u20133820 calBCE) were assigned to the Narva Culture that occupied the Eastern Baltic region from the Late Mesolithic to the Middle Neolithic (Baltic EMN Narva) and two individuals from Estonia were associated with the CCC that was spread across the northern part of the Eastern Baltic by the Middle Neolithic (Baltic MN CCC; dated to ca. 3800\u20133360 calBCE).",
            "Five individuals from Lithuania and Estonia were dated to the Late Neolithic (Baltic LN; ca. 3260\u20131750 calBCE). For the individual Gyvakarai1, we present genome-wide data at 7.6-fold average coverage from shotgun sequencing.",
            "Fourteen samples from Latvia and Lithuania were attributed to the Baltic Bronze Age (Baltic BA) and date to ca. 1230\u2013230 calBCE.",
            "We supplemented our dataset of ancient Eastern Baltic samples with recently published data from 13 individuals spanning the Mesolithic to Late Neolithic in Latvia and Estonia, and merged data from identical individuals where they overlapped with the latter. We present the first data from the southernmost region of the Eastern Baltic (the territory of modern-day Lithuania), the Early Neolithic of Estonia and the Eastern Baltic Bronze Age.",
            "From southern Sweden, we analyzed one farmer (3950\u20133650 calBCE) from the EN TRB, the earliest agricultural population in Scandinavia for which there exists no genetic data to date. One sample from northern Sweden (Scandinavia LNBA Olsund, ca. 2570\u20132140 calBCE) dates to the Late Neolithic but was found without associated archaeological assemblages. The data were analyzed in context with published data from the Scandinavian Middle Neolithic to Bronze Age as well as other ancient and modern genome-wide datasets described below.",
            "Affinities of northern Mesolithic hunter-gatherers",
            "To gain an overview of the broad genetic affinities of our samples, we projected all 38 ancient genome-wide datasets, as well as previously published ancient samples, using a principal component analysis (PCA), constructed from 1007 modern individuals from a diverse set of West Eurasian contemporary populations, and used the same individuals to investigate model-based clustering using ADMIXTURE. We see that the Mesolithic foragers of Northern Europe fall into three distinct clusters, associated with EHG, SHG and WHG, respectively, as evidenced by their position on the PCA (Fig.\u00a02a), similar composition of ancestral genetic clusters in ADMIXTURE analysis (Fig.\u00a02b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04) and in sharing most genetic drift since divergence from Africa as shown by outgroup f3-statistics (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Based on these results, our Mesolithic Russian foragers fall within the EHG cluster formed by previously published samples and are grouped as EHG in subsequent analyses.",
            "ADMIXTURE shows that EHG carry a genetic component (green component in Fig.\u00a02b) that is maximized in hunter-gatherers from the Caucasus (CHG) and shared with Neolithic farmers from Iran and Steppe populations from the Bronze Age, suggesting some common ancestry for these populations, consistent with previous results.",
            "Despite their geographical vicinity to EHG, the two Eastern Baltic individuals associated with the Mesolithic Kunda Culture show a very close affinity to WHG in all our analyses (Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Figs.\u00a01 and 2), with a significant contribution from ANE, as revealed by negative admixture f3 results involving a Palaeolithic hunter-gatherer from Switzerland, most closely related to WHG, and populations containing ANE ancestry (Supplementary Table\u00a01). This is additionally confirmed by D-statistics of the form D(Baltic Mesolithic, WHG; X, Mbuti) for populations X with ANE ancestry, which are significant and among the highest in EHG (Z\u2009=\u20096.2; Supplementary Table\u00a02). Using the qpWave/qpAdm framework, we modelled the Baltic Mesolithic hunter-gatherers as a two-way mixture between EHG and WHG (Fig.\u00a03), which reveals a difference in mixture proportions between the more northern individuals from the Latvian site (65\u201376% WHG with 24\u201335% EHG; Supplementary Table\u00a03) and the samples from the Lithuanian sites to the south (88\u2013100% WHG with 0\u201312% EHG; Supplementary Table\u00a03).",
            "SHG appear intermediate between WHG/Baltic Mesolithic and EHG in PCA space, have increased shared genetic drift with both shown in outgroup f3-statistics (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03) and the statistic D(SHG,WHG; EHG, Mbuti) is strongly significant for excess allele sharing of SHG and EHG (Z\u2009=\u20097.3; Supplementary Table\u00a04). Using qpAdm, we confirm the previously published result of SHG being formed by admixture of WHG and EHG (57\u2009\u00b1\u20092% WHG with 43\u2009\u00b1\u20092% EHG; p\u2009=\u20090.19; Supplementary Table\u00a03). Both EHG and SHG share a non-negligible component in ADMIXTURE analysis that is maximized in some modern Native American populations which points towards ANE ancestry, as represented by the MA1 and AG3 samples from Palaeolithic Siberia (maroon component in Fig.\u00a02a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Indeed, D-statistics show that EHG and SHG share significantly more alleles with MA1 and AG3 than WHG (Supplementary Tables\u00a02 and 4). Additionally, mtDNA haplogroups found among EHG point towards an eastern influence (Table\u00a01): R1b in UzOO77 (this individual had previously been assigned to haplogroup H) was also found in the Palaeolithic Siberian AG3 and a haplogroup within the C1 clade, which appears today in highest frequencies in north-east Asia and the Americas, was described in several samples from Yuzhnyy Oleni Ostrov. It was shown that some SHG carry the derived variant of the EDAR allele, which affects hair thickness and tooth morphology among other things, and which is found today in high frequency in East Asians and Native Americans.",
            "Dynamic forager networks in the Eastern Baltic Neolithic",
            "Similarly to the Baltic Mesolithic, the later Eastern Baltic Neolithic hunter-gatherers of the Narva culture exhibit varying proportions of EHG (0\u201346%) and WHG (54\u2013100%) ancestry (Fig.\u00a03 and Supplementary Table\u00a03). In principle, it is possible that such a pattern is not the result of admixture but a signal of a long-standing geographic cline. However, in this case, it appears to be more compatible with recent admixture between differentially WHG- and EHG-related groups, as we see varying ancestry proportions even within contemporary individuals from the same site or closely located sites (Fig.\u00a03). D-statistics of the form D(Baltic EMN Narva, WHG; X, Mbuti) do not show evidence of admixture with the contemporaneous European farming populations that were related to the Anatolian Neolithic (Supplementary Tables\u00a02 and 5). The later individuals attributed to the Baltic MN CCC exhibit a significantly higher affinity to EHG with the ancestry proportion estimated at 68\u201399% EHG and 1\u201332% WHG (Fig.\u00a03, Supplementary Table\u00a03).",
            "Similar to other European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, our Baltic foragers carry a high frequency of the derived HERC2 allele which codes for light iris colour, and like SHG and EHG they already possess an increased frequency of the derived alleles for SLC45A2 and SLC24A5, coding for lighter skin colour (Supplementary Table\u00a06). The male individuals carry Y-chromosomal haplogroups of the I and R1 clades (Table\u00a01, Supplementary Note\u00a03). Y-haplogroup I has been most commonly found among WHG and SHG while R1 is found in EHG and other published Eastern Baltic and Romanian hunter-gatherers.",
            "One Narva individual, Spiginas1, dated to ca. 4440\u20134240 calBCE, belongs to a mitochondrial haplogroup of the H branch, normally associated with the Neolithic expansion into Europe, but shows no evidence of Neolithic farmer ancestry on the nuclear level suggesting that this haplogroup might have been present already in foraging groups (Table\u00a01, Supplementary Table\u00a05). In addition to haplogroup H, the maternal lineages seen in Eastern Baltic samples (n\u2009=\u200935; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05) encompass all of the major haplogroups identified in complete mtDNA genomes from Holocene Scandinavian and Western European hunter-gatherers (n\u2009=\u200921:U2, U5a, U5b), as well as haplogroup U4 which has been found in high frequency in Mesolithic foragers from Russia. We also find mtDNA branch K1, a subclade of U8, in one Baltic Mesolithic forager, adding to the mounting evidence that this lineage was present at low frequency among European hunter-gatherers before the arrival of agriculturalists.",
            "Early farming in Sweden coincides with a shift in ancestry",
            "In contrast to the Eastern Baltic, we see clear evidence for the genetic impact of the Neolithic expansion already around 4000 calBCE in southern Sweden. The individual associated with the EN TRB culture clusters with Middle and Early Neolithic farmers from Europe on the PCA (Fig.\u00a02a) and in the ADMIXTURE analysis exhibits the component maximized in Levantine and West Anatolian early farmers (orange component in Fig.\u00a02b). D-statistics show increased allele sharing of EN TRB with hunter-gatherer populations in comparison to the preceding farmers of the Linearbandkeramik (LBK) culture and no difference to the contemporaneous Middle Neolithic and Chalcolithic (MNChL) farmers of Central Europe (Supplementary Table\u00a04), paralleling the previously described resurgence of WHG ancestry during the European Middle Neolithic. Different models of EN TRB as a linear combination of LBK with SHG, WHG or Baltic hunter-gatherers favour the latter two groups, while SHG is rejected as a source (Supplementary Table\u00a03).",
            "The previously published succeeding farmers of the Middle Neolithic (MN) TRB culture in West Sweden appear as directly descended from the EN TRB, with no significant positive results for D(MN TRB, EN TRB; X, Mbuti) (Supplementary Table\u00a04).",
            "The PWC individuals, who were contemporaneous to the MN TRB but relied mainly on marine resources, appear intermediate between SHG and Middle Neolithic farming cultures on the PCA (Fig.\u00a02a). Indeed, the statistic D(PWC, SHG; X, Mbuti) reaches weak significance when X is MN TRB (Z\u2009=\u20092.94) and a two-way admixture model for PWC involving SHG and TRB farmers is not rejected by qpWave/qpAdm (74\u2009\u00b1\u20096% SHG and 26\u2009\u00b1\u20096% EN TRB; Supplementary Table\u00a03).",
            "New networks of contact during the LNBA",
            "The substantial population movement at the beginning of the 3rd millennium calBCE, during the European LNBA, affected the genetic makeup of Eastern and Central Europe and Scandinavia. It also made its mark in the Eastern Baltic region, as seen in our five samples from Lithuania and Estonia dated to this period and the previously published individuals from the Eastern Baltic region. All Baltic LN individuals (ca. 3200\u20131750 calBCE) fall in PCA space in the diffuse European LNBA cluster formed by individuals admixed between Early and Middle Bronze Age pastoralists from the Yamnaya culture of the eastern Pontic Steppe and Middle Neolithic European farmers (Fig.\u00a02a). They all carry the genetic component that was introduced into Europe with this pastoralist migration in varying amounts, and the majority also carries the component associated with Anatolian farmers (green and orange, respectively, in Fig.\u00a02b). This genetic impact is furthermore reflected in the uniparental markers where we see novel mitochondrial haplogroups (I, J, T2, W), not found in the preceding foragers, in half of our samples (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05), and I2a Y-chromosomal haplogroups replaced by R1a types (Table\u00a01, Supplementary Note\u00a03).",
            "Computing D-statistics for each individual of the form D(Baltic LN, Yamnaya; X, Mbuti), we find that the two individuals from the early phase of the LN (Plinkaigalis242 and Gyvakarai1, dating to ca. 3200\u20132600 calBCE) form a clade with Yamnaya (Supplementary Table\u00a07), consistent with the absence of the farmer-associated component in ADMIXTURE (Fig.\u00a02b). Younger individuals share more alleles with Anatolian and European farmers (Supplementary Table\u00a07) as also observed in contemporaneous Central European CWC individuals. The individual Spiginas2, dated to a very late period of the LN (2130\u20131750 calBCE), stands out in that it shares an excess of alleles with European forager groups when compared to the Yamnaya populations, with the top hits being Switzerland_HG, WHG, Baltic Mesolithic and Baltic EMN Narva (Supplementary Table\u00a07).",
            "This result is the earliest evidence for a continuing pattern: we observe that the increased affinity to Baltic hunter-gatherers remains prevalent in the more recent samples from the Baltic BA (dated between ca. 1000 and 230 calBCE) that cluster together on the PCA in the same space occupied by modern Lithuanians and Estonians, shifted from other Europeans to WHG and Baltic hunter-gatherers (Fig.\u00a02a). The statistic D(Baltic BA, Baltic LN; Baltic EMN Narva, Mbuti) is strongly significant (Z\u2009=\u200914.0; Supplementary Table\u00a02) demonstrating the increase in allele sharing with local hunter-gatherers in the Baltic populations after the Late Neolithic. Replacing Baltic EMN Narva with the contemporaneous northern population of Baltic MN CCC does not yield significant results, suggesting that admixture with this population did not play a large role in the ancestry of our studied Bronze Age individuals. Additionally, D-statistics provide significantly positive results for D(Baltic BA, Baltic LN; X, Mbuti) when X was replaced by various agricultural populations of Europe and the Near East (Supplementary Table\u00a02), which suggests that the formation of the Baltic BA gene pool was not completed by admixture between the Baltic LN population and foragers but involved additional gene-flow from outside the Baltic territory. Archaeological evidence supports that the site Kivutkalns, which is represented by 10 of our individuals, was a major bronze-working centre located on a trade route that opened to the Baltic Sea on the west and led inland following the Daugava river, where contact to surrounding populations might have been common.",
            "The individual from Olsund in north-eastern Sweden was dated to the Late Neolithic, when agriculture had been introduced to the coastal areas of northern Sweden with the Battle Axe Culture, the regional variant of the CWC, while foraging persisted as an important form of subsistence. The remains were found without any associated artefacts, but in close proximity to a site where the assemblage showed a mix between local hunter-gatherer traditions and CWC influence.",
            "On the PCA plot, this sample falls within the European LNBA cluster (Fig.\u00a02a) and similarly to other individuals from this cluster displays the three components derived from WHG, CHG and Neolithic Levant (Fig.\u00a02b). This provides genomic evidence for the influence of both the early Neolithic and LNBA expansions having reached as far as northern Sweden in the 3rd millennium calBCE, either through a northward expansion from southern Scandinavia or across the Baltic Sea by boat or over the frozen sea. Assemblages similar to the early Battle Axe Culture of Sweden have been found in south-western Finland, across the Bothnian Sea which could be considered a geographically closer source than southern Scandinavia.",
            "Gene-flow into the Eastern Baltic after the Bronze Age",
            "Modern Eastern Baltic populations cluster with Baltic BA on the PCA plot and exhibit among all modern populations the highest shared genetic drift with ancient Baltic populations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02), but show substantial differences to samples from the Bronze Age. The statistic D(Lithuanian, Baltic BA; X, Mbuti) reveals significantly positive results for many modern Near Eastern and Southern European populations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). Limited gene-flow from more south-western neighbouring regions after the Bronze Age is sufficient to explain this pattern, as nearly all modern populations besides Estonians, especially for Central and Western Europe, have a higher amount of farmer ancestry than Lithuanians.",
            "In contrast, the statistic D(Estonian, BA Baltic; X, Mbuti) gives significant positive hits for East Asian and Siberian populations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b).",
            "None of our male Bronze Age individuals carry Y-haplogroup N, which is found in modern Europeans in highest frequencies in Finland and the Baltic states. Instead, we observe a high frequency of R1a Y-haplogroups.",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "Our analyses support a dynamic population history of the Baltic Sea region, where populations did not remain in \u2018genetic stasis\u2019 despite the late adoption of agrarian subsistence strategies when compared to the rest of Europe.",
            "The Mesolithic SHG excavated at Motala, Sweden, owe their genetic signature to an admixture of WHG and EHG and similarly to the latter carry substantial ANE ancestry. In contrast, the two Eastern Baltic Mesolithic Kunda individuals, who predate the SHG, carry comparatively low proportions of ANE ancestry, indicating that this ancestry was never widespread to the southeast of the Baltic Sea and likely reached Scandinavia without traversing the Eastern Baltic. This provides indirect support to the archaeological evidence that Scandinavia was settled by two routes, suggesting a scenario in which the ANE-related ancestry was brought into Scandinavia with a movement of people via a north-eastern coastal route, where they admixed with a WHG-like population that derived from a migration over the land-bridge that connected Denmark and southern Sweden at the time.\u00a0This scenario is also supported by the finding that\u00a0three Mesolithic hunter-gatherers excavated at the coast of Norway carry\u00a0a higher\u00a0proportion of EHG ancestry compared to the individuals from\u00a0inland\u00a0Sweden.",
            "In southern Scandinavia, the sequence of events resembles that seen in Central Europe, albeit several millennia later, in that the earliest agriculture in the region coincides with the appearance of people related to the Anatolian and European Neolithic. However, similar to Middle Neolithic Central and Southern European populations, early Scandinavian farmers are already strongly admixed with hunter-gatherer groups. Without the knowledge of the genetic substrate in Mesolithic southern Scandinavia, these results are consistent with different scenarios; e.g. a movement of a Central European population into southern Scandinavia without admixture with local SHG-like populations, or local admixture of LBK-like farmers with a forager population that shows more similarity to WHG or Baltic hunter-gatherers. A detailed joint analysis of genetic and archaeological data from hunter-gatherers from northern Germany, Denmark and the southern tip of Sweden is necessary to establish the role of local admixture during the emergence of the TRB culture. Our data support that the Neolithic PWC foragers are largely genetically continuous to SHG, which is congruent with their similarities in subsistence strategies, while continuity between EN TRB and PWC can also be seen in archaeological assemblages and can be attributed to contact between farmers and foragers. Indeed, genetic evidence of admixture between these groups shows that they were not completely isolated from each other but did likely not uphold continuous contact nor intermarry frequently during their prolonged parallel existence in Scandinavia.",
            "In the archaeological understanding, the transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic in the Eastern Baltic region does not coincide with a large-scale population turnover and a stark shift in economy as seen in Central and Southern Europe. Rather, it is signified by a change in networks of contacts and the use of pottery, among other material, cultural and economic changes. Our results suggest continued admixture between groups in the south of the Eastern Baltic region, who are more closely related to WHG, and northern or eastern groups, more closely related to EHG. Neolithic social networks from the Eastern Baltic to the River Volga could also explain similarities of the hunter-gatherer pottery styles, although morphologically analogous ceramics might also have developed independently due to similar functionality. The genetic evidence for a change in networks and possibly even a large-scale population movement is most pronounced in the Middle Neolithic in individuals attributed to the CCC. The distribution of this culture overlaps in the north with the Narva culture and extends further north to Finland and Karelia. Its spread in the Eastern Baltic is linked with a significant change in imported raw materials, artefacts, and the appearance of village-like settlements.",
            "We see a further population movement into the regions surrounding the Baltic Sea with the CWC in the Late Neolithic that was accompanied by the first evidence of extensive animal husbandry in the Eastern Baltic. The presence of ancestry from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe among Baltic CWC individuals without the genetic component from north-western Anatolian Neolithic farmers must be due to a direct migration of steppe pastoralists that did not pick up this ancestry in Central Europe. It suggests import of the new economy by an incoming steppe-like population independent of the agricultural societies that were already established to the south and west of the Baltic Sea. The presence of direct contacts to the steppe could lend support to a linguistic model that sees an early branching of Balto-Slavic from a Proto-Indo-European language, for which the west Eurasian steppe was proposed as a homeland. However, as farmer ancestry is found in later Eastern Baltic individuals, it is likely that considerable individual mobility and a network of contact throughout the range of the CWC facilitated its spread eastward, possibly through exogamous marriage practices. Conversely, the appearance of mitochondrial haplogroup U4 in the Central European Late Neolithic after millennia of absence could indicate female gene-flow from the Eastern Baltic, where this haplogroup was present at high frequency.",
            "Local foraging societies were, however, not completely replaced and contributed a substantial proportion to the ancestry of Eastern Baltic individuals of the latest LN and Bronze Age. This \u2018resurgence\u2019 of hunter-gatherer ancestry in the local population through admixture between foraging and farming groups recalls the same phenomenon observed in the European Middle Neolithic and is responsible for the unique genetic signature of modern-day Eastern Baltic populations.",
            "We suggest that the Siberian and East Asian related ancestry in Estonia, and Y-haplogroup N in north-eastern Europe, where it is widespread today, arrived there after the Bronze Age, ca. 500 calBCE, as we detect neither in our Bronze Age samples from Lithuania and Latvia. As Uralic speaking populations of the Volga-Ural region show high frequencies of haplogroup N, a connection was proposed with the spread of Uralic language speakers from the east that contributed to the male gene pool of Eastern Baltic populations and left linguistic descendants in the Finno-Ugric languages Finnish and Estonian. A potential future direction of research is the identification of the proximate population that contributed to the arrival of this eastern ancestry into Northern Europe.",

From Scandinavia (Sweden), we sampled 22 human remains from Mesolithic, early TRB and LN contexts. Two samples from north-western Russia were associated with Mesolithic contexts.

The human remains were treated with ultraviolet (UV) light from all sides for 10\u2009min to reduce surface DNA contamination.

            "X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia is a heterogeneous nonprogressive neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in early childhood. We searched for a genetic cause of this condition, previously reported in a Buryat pedigree of Mongolian ancestry from southeastern Russia. Using whole-genome sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, we found a missense mutation in theABCB7(ABC-binding cassette transporter B7) gene, encoding a mitochondrial transporter, involved in heme synthesis and previously associated with sideroblastic anemia and ataxia. The mutation resulting in a substitution of a highly conserved glycine to serine in position 682 is apparently a major causative factor of the cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy found in affected individuals of a Buryat family who had no evidence of sideroblastic anemia. Moreover, in these affected men we also found the genetic defects in two other genes closely linked toABCB7on chromosome X: a deletion of a genomic region harboring the second exon of copper-transporter gene (ATP7A) and a complete deletion ofPGAM4(phosphoglycerate mutase family member 4) retrogene located in the intronic region of theATP7Agene. Despite the deletion, eliminating the first of six metal-binding domains inATP7A, no signs for Menkes disease or occipital horn syndrome associated withATP7Amutations were found in male carriers. The role of thePGAM4gene has been previously implicated in human reproduction, but our data indicate that its complete loss does not disrupt male fertility. Our finding links cerebellar pathology to the genetic defect inABCB7andATP7Astructural variant inherited as X-linked trait, and further reveals the genetic heterogeneity of X-linked cerebellar disorders.",
            "X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia is a heterogeneous nonprogressive disease that occurs generally in the first years of life and is characterized by developmental delay and difficulties in coordination owing to hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebellum. Most of the congenital cerebellar hypoplasia and atrophy cases, such as oligophrenin-1 syndrome (OMIM: 300486) or MICPCH/CASK syndrome (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (membrane-associated guanylate kinase family (MAGUK) family); OMIM: 300749), are considered to be X-chromosome-associated intellectual disability pathologies.1,2Loss of function of oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) gene leads to cerebellar hypoplasia and frontotemporal atrophy,1and to hippocampal alterations3by affecting Rho GTPase-dependent signaling required in cell migration and morphogenesis, synapse maturation and plasticity of neurons. Similarly, the dysfunction ofCASKgene, which encodes the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (MAGUK family), is associated with ataxia, mental retardation and microcephaly.2The cerebellar dysfunctions are also linked to ion exchange abnormalities. In one familial case, the cause of the disease was a Ca2+imbalance as a result of mutation in theATP2B3gene, an ATPase transmembrane transporter that moves Ca2+ions out of the cell against concentration gradients.4In another case, the X-linked spinocerebellar ataxia was linked to a nonsynonymous variant in theGJB1gene encoding protein connexin 32, which supports ions and transfer of small molecules by forming gap junction channels between cells.5Here, we report the case of inherited neurological pathology linked to genetic defects in genes for metal-ion transporters in a large Buryat pedigree (Figure 1).6",

            "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed hypoplasia of cerebellar hemispheres and vermis in affected males from the Buryat pedigree. Common neurological symptoms for all affected family members were development delay, difficulties in speech and coordination, limb and truncal ataxia and dysarthria (Supplementary Table 1). The patients examined were not able to sit without support any time before 15 months of age, or to walk independently before 7 years of age and to speak their first words before 4 years of age. For the majority of patients, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia and increased tendon reflexes were observed. There were no signs of memory or cognitive impairment in all the patients from this pedigree.6",
            "Features of sideroblastic anemia or copper disorder were not detected.

We narrowed down the candidate-gene list by excludingNHSL2(Gene ID: 340527),AMER1(Gene ID: 139285),PHKA1(Gene ID: 5255) andRGAG1(Gene ID: 57529) based on evolutionary analysis, gene expression profiles in tissues and protein topology position (Supplementary Figure 1).NHSL2gene was excluded because there are no reports on association of rare variants in theNHSL2gene, including the rs72630038 (SCV000221324) (MAF=0.045 in 1000 Genomes Project Consortium15) found in the Buryat patient, with any disorder; low expression of the gene in the cerebellum at prenatal period;16,17and that at least one mammalian species (hedgehog) bears the same rare amino-acid variant inNHSL2. Mutations in theAMER1gene are known as genetic factors underlying osteopathia striata, cranial sclerosis and intellectual disability syndrome (OMIM: 300647 and 300373). We excludedAMER1gene because of the clinical phenotype differences in our patients and location of the variant (SCV000221323) in evolutionarily non-conserved region of the protein. Mutations in thePHKA1gene lead to X-linked muscle glycogenosis (OMIM: 311870 and OMIM 300559), which is also distant from the observed clinical symptoms in our patients. The amino-acid substitution arginine to glutamine (SCV000221325) in the PHKA1 protein occurred in non-conserved position. Variant inRGAG1(retrotransposon gag domain containing 1 protein) gene (SCV000221326) is also localized in a non-conserved position. Ultimately, we identified the genetic defects in two closely linked genes, both essential for metal transport. We found that the missense mutation in exon 16 of theABCB7(ABC-binding cassette transporter B7) gene (SCV000221289), which is in linkage disequilibrium with a large 41.4\u2009kb deletion in theATP7Agene on X-chromosome (SCV000221290) in this family, is the most probable causative factor for the neurological disease of the Buryat patients (Figure 2).",

As the identified variant is localized near an acceptor splice site within the first coding triplet of exon 16, we examined if the substitution could lead to the formation of a new strong splice site. The bioinformatic tools testing putative splicing sites based on nucleotide frequencies in each site position (from \u221220 to +3) for constitutive, cassette, inner acceptors and outer acceptors predicted no splicing alterations for the mutant allele18,19(Supplementary Table 5).",
            "There are several known transcripts ofABCB7gene encoding protein isoforms, and the identified variant affects all predicted protein isoforms. The structure and function of ABCB7 protein domains are not fully understood. The mutation is located in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of ABCB7 protein (NP_001258625, UniProtO75027), and disruption of this region in ATM1 yeast ortholog leads to the loss of protein function and iron accumulation inside the mitochondrion (Supplementary Figure 3A).20We studied structural alterations in the ABCB7 protein bearing mutant serine variant using the bioinformatics program Phyre2.21Comparative analysis of ~1000 paralogous and orthologous amino-acid sequences of superfamily ABC transporter proteins shows a highly conserved glycine variant in position 682 (Figure 3). Serine substitution leads to rotation in the motionless protein side. Additional bioinformatic predictions for this mutation were performed. The mutant variant inABCB7gene was assessed as deleterious by SIFT22and probably damaging (0.996) by PolyPhen.23To date, four other mutations were found in theABCB7gene associated with sideroblastic anemia and cerebellar ataxia (Supplementary Figure 3A).",

            "We identified a deletion of region hg19 chrX:g.77190006_77231471del encompassing exon 2 (U27361), partially, introns 2 and 3 of theATP7Agene (Gene ID:538) andPGAM4(phosphoglycerate mutase family member 4) retrogene (Gene ID:441531) (Figures 2b, d and f). This deletion of theATP7Agene is located at a distance of 2.8\u2009Mb fromABCB7gene and eliminates the original translation start site in exon 2. We suggest that an alternative start codon, for example, in exon 3 can be instead used for the same open reading frame (predicted by ATGpr24). The resulting protein will lack the first 68 amino-acid residuals, which constitute the first of six metal-binding domains (MBDs) (Supplementary Figure 3B). As the ATP7A protein (NP_000043.4,Q04656) has six isoforms,25the deletion disrupts the open reading frame for the two short ones with unknown biological significance (Supplementary Figure 4). TheATP7Agene homologs are present in a broad range of organisms: from unicellular to complex multicellular organisms. The first MBD encoded by exon 2 is evolutionarily conserved in mammals, birds and reptiles. However, prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes have only one to three MDBs. We testedATP7Agene expression in the adult cortex and cerebellum and found the presence of a transcript product corresponding to protein-encoding transcript sequence in the frontal cortex but not in the cerebellum (Supplementary Figure 5).",
            "Mutations in theATP7Agene have been linked to copper deficiency/Menkes disease (MD; OMIM: 309400), characterized by severe mental retardation, seizures, growth retardation, hypothermia, kinky or steely hair, laxity of skin and joints and early age mortality. More mild occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is also associated with mutations in theATP7Agene (OMIM: 304150). Yet, neither of the clinical features of these diseases have been detected in Buryat patients lacking the second exon of theATP7Agene. We assumed that the deletion may have a relatively modest, if any, effect on clinical phenotype in these patients, which is unrelated to previously described clinical symptoms associated with mutations in theATP7Agene.",
            "Protein-coding retrogenePGAM4(Gene ID: 441531) is localized in the first intron of theATP7Agene and is transcribed from the opposite strand.PGAM4is a functional retrocopy ofPGAM1gene. Phosphoglycerate mutase catalyzes the isomerization reactions of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate in the glycolytic pathway. The gene for original functional enzymePGAM1is highly expressed in the brain (Illumina Human Body Map 2.0, ArrayExpress accession no. E-MTAB-513).26PGAM4retrogene has promoter-specific sequences of TATA boxes and CAAT box and is highly expressed in the testes. However, there is no evidence of activity of this gene in human cerebellum or cerebral cortical neurons27(Supplementary Figure 6). This retrogenePGAM4protein (NP_001025062,Q8N0Y7) has LxRHGExxxN motif specific for enzymatic activity of phosphoglycerate mutase family. ThePGAM4is present only in higher primates: human, chimpanzees and gorillas. The biological significance of the gene is unknown, butPGAM4has been associated with male fertility28and spermatogenesis.29Interestingly, although our data indicate that the full sequence ofPGAM4retrogene was lost, the Buryat patient with cerebellar pathology and carrier of the above-described X-linkedABCB7-ATP7A-PGAM4genetic variants was married and fathered three healthy sons. As anticipated, the genotyping of one of the sons available for this study revealed inheritance of X-chromosome wild-type allele from his mother. Given the potential role of thePGAM4gene on male fertility, we verified genetic paternity for the patient and his sons. Using homemade and commercial informative STR markers, we confirmed the authentic biological paternity of the patient bearing the X-linkedABCB7-ATP7A-PGAM4genetic variants. Thus, these results suggest that the naturally occurring knockout ofPGAM4does not disrupt the male fertility. However, given that all offsprings of the patient were males, the pathogenic effect of gene loss on generation or maintenance of X-chromosome-bearing spermatozoids cannot be ruled out.",
            "We found the mutation/deletion inABCB7andATP7Agenes in all four examined affected male relatives of this Buryat family with the same diagnosis and in four asymptomatic females relatives with the affected sons (Supplementary Table 6). The mutation/deletion was in the hemizygotic state in all examined affected males and in every female carrier it was heterozygous. All four examined healthy men from the same pedigree were hemizygous for wild-type alleles.",
            "We further tested four unrelated families of patients with the very similar clinical manifestation and with diagnosis of congenital nonprogressive ataxia occurring exclusively in males (Supplementary Table 7). The analysis of all exons of theABCB7gene by direct sequencing (Supplementary Table 8) did not exhibit any differences when compared with human reference genome sequences. Similarly, we found no deletion of exon 2 of theATP7Agene and retrogenePGAM4in affected males in these families. The genotyping of these families for mutationNM_001001344.2:c.3321G>A (p.Gly1107Asp) in theATP2B3gene, which was previously described in cases of cerebellum ataxia,4also revealed no difference from wild-type reference allele.",
            "The common feature among nonprogressive ataxias is a noticeable delay in early motor development and a disturbance of motor coordination during the life as a result of cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy. Here, we report a novel mutation inABCB7that is a causative factor of cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy and nonprogressive ataxia, thus further expanding the list of mutations in this gene linked to cerebellar ataxia. Previously, four different mutations found inABCB7were linked to cerebellar pathology with sideroblastic anemia. In sideroblastic anemia iron is not incorporated into hemoglobin as it is required to produce healthy erythrocytes by bone marrow. However, the remarkable feature of our case is that the patients have nonprogressive ataxia without the classic symptoms of sideroblastic anemia. It is tempting to speculate that this is because of a unique location of the mutation inABCB7. Alternatively, the deletion of N-terminal part of the ATP7A may potentially have a role in modifying the genetic factor.",
            "ABCB7 protein consists of six transmembrane domains and two intramitochondrial regions, forming NBD (Supplementary Figure 3A). It is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, as well as on the cytoplasmic membrane and in the cytoplasm.30ABCB7has an important role in maturation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Fe-S cluster proteins, affecting the function of cytochromec, NADH dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, the reduced form) and succinate dehydrogenase. It is involved in DNA repair and nucleotide excision repair, in oxidative DNA damage repair, in ribosome biogenesis and tRNA thiomodification.31The mutation of ABCB7 protein in our patients is located in the domain facing the inner mitochondrial space. All other mutations described to date, causing refractory anemia and ataxia, are localized near or in the transmembrane domains.20,32,33,34,35,36As such, this mutation may affect its activity or binding with other co-factors, as ABCB7 controls mitochondrial iron transport and protoporphyrin binding during hemoglobin synthesis.20,32,33,36",
            "The mental and neurological symptoms are varied in patients with described mutations in theABCB7gene. The depression, cognitive declines or intellectual disabilities and even schizophrenia were described for some patients (Supplementary Table 9). Neurological manifestations in the affected members of the Buryat family demonstrate some common features with theABCB7mutation \u2013 associated symptoms in other cases, such as cerebellar ataxia, lack of muscle weakness and deficiency of sensation (Supplementary Table 9). As shown by MRI in the Buryat family case, the brain atrophy was mostly localized in the cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis. However, we failed to detect abnormalities in other regions, including pons and medulla shown in other cases.34",
            "TheABCB7mutation in our patients is coupled with the deletion in ATPase copper-transporter gene (ATP7A) (Supplementary Figure 7). Surprisingly, the deletion in the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal part of ATP7A found in individuals from the Buryat family does not lead to disease manifestations described for carriers ofATP7Amutations. The disruption of this gene is linked to several clinically different disorders characterized by copper metabolic disturbance (OMIM: 300011) including MD (OMIM: 309400) and OHS (OMIM: 304150). Depending on the specific mutation, it can lead to early childhood lethality (before 3 years old), which is characterized by infantile-onset cerebral and cerebellar neurodegeneration, heavy mental retardation and arrest of development. A milder form of MD is not lethal and exhibits weaker clinical symptoms.37TheATP7Agene mutations also lead to OHS, characterized by a connective tissue disorder and skeletal abnormalities often associated with mild mental retardation (OMIM: 304150), or to distal motor neuropathy, characterized by motor nerve degeneration in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and atrophy of lower and upper extremities (OMIM: 300489). Interestingly, the expression of ATP7A protein is inversely correlated with the severity of the disease phenotype.38Despite the loss of the first of six MBDs of ATP7A, the patients from the Buryat family did not show any clinical signs of theATP7A-associated disorders reported to date. Among the mutation spectrum described forATP7Agene, the gross deletions were represented in ~15% of the MD patients.39Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in males carrying theATP7Adeletion of the first MBD, the remaining five copper-binding domains are efficiently used to retain the function ofATP7A.",
            "We cannot rule out that the dysfunction in ABCB7 and modestly modified activity of ATP7A may mutually affect homeostasis in some tissue cells, as ABCB7 impairment may cause an accumulation of iron ions in the mitochondria, whereas a mutation of ATP7A transporter may affect copper ion levels in the cell cytoplasm. The iron deficiency increases intestinal tissue expression of ATP7A40and brain copper levels.41Copper is known to regulate iron utilization in the bone marrow and in hemoglobin synthesis.42,43,44,45Importantly, bothABCB7andATP7Agenes are expressed in the bone marrow26,46and in various tissues (Illumina Human Body Map 2.0),26,46,47(Supplementary Figure 5). Given the mutual regulatory influence of the copper and iron uptake, the clinical phenotype described in the Buryat patients may depend on presumable interaction of genetic defects in two genes for the MBPs in some tissue cells, an interesting case of syndrome inherited as a X-linked monogenic trait. We, however, argue that the major cause of cerebellar hypoplasia and the clinical phenotype of ataxia in these patients is caused by this novel mutation in theABCB7gene.",

            "To elucidate whether Bronze Age population dispersals from the Eurasian Steppe to South Asia contributed to the gene pool of Indo-Iranian-speaking groups, we analyzed 19,568 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from northern Pakistani and surrounding populations, including 213 newly generated mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from Iranian and Dardic groups, both speakers from the ancient Indo-Iranian branch in northern Pakistan. Our results showed that 23% of mtDNA lineages with west Eurasian origin arose in situ in northern Pakistan since ~5000 years ago (kya), a time depth very close to the documented Indo-European dispersals into South Asia during the Bronze Age. Together with ancient mitogenomes from western Eurasia since the Neolithic, we identified five haplogroups (~8.4% of maternal gene pool) with roots in the Steppe region and subbranches arising (age ~5\u20132\u2009kya old) in northern Pakistan as genetic legacies of Indo-Iranian\u00a0speakers. Some of these haplogroups, such as W3a1b that have been found in the ancient samples from the late Bronze Age to the Iron Age period individuals of Swat Valley northern Pakistan, even have sub-lineages (age ~4\u2009kya old) in the southern subcontinent, consistent with the southward spread of Indo-Iranian languages. By showing that substantial genetic components of Indo-Iranian\u00a0speakers in northern Pakistan can be traced to Bronze Age in the Steppe region, our study suggests a demographic link with the spread of Indo-Iranian languages, and further highlights the corridor role of northern Pakistan in the southward dispersal of Indo-Iranian-speaking groups.",
            "Subject terms:Evolutionary biology, Molecular biology",
            "As the world\u2019s most widely spoken language family (3.2 billion speakers) [1], the Indo-European (IE) languages recorded to predominate the Eurasian Steppe and beyond, extending some 8000\u2009km across Eurasia from East Asia (northeast China) to as far as Central Europe. One of the most widely accepted hypotheses posits that this language family originated in the Pontic Steppe in association with the formation and extension of the Yamnaya cultural complex during the Bronze Age (3000\u20131000bc) [2,3]. An alternative popular view suggests relatively earlier diffusion of IE languages from Anatolia with the expansion of farming (7000\u20136000bc) [4], which also has received support from ancient genome data [5]. In Europe, the expansion of some branches of IE languages from their eastern periphery has been suggested with the dispersal of Yamnaya-related populations, largely consistent with Bronze Age migrations from the Steppe [3,6]. However, controversy still exists regarding how the largest extant branch of IE languages, i.e., the Indo-Iranian family, expanded southward to South Asia. Certain studies have indicated substantial genetic contributions from western Eurasia introduced with the expansion of IE languages into South Asia (especially northern India) [7\u201310], whereas others have suggested that this genetic introgression is rather limited [11\u201314]. It is also widely argued that the early proto-Indo-Aryan speakers began to appear at the Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Southern Central Asia ~2000bcbefore they expanded to the South Asian borderlands [2]; however, recent report of genome-wide ancient DNA data from Central and South Asia suggests no substantial genetic contribution from BMAC to South Asians [10]. Therefore, it is still controversial about whether there are substantial genetic contributions from the Steppe into the South Asia along with the expansion of IE speakers. Moreover, due to the different extent of genetic admixtures between Indo-Iranian speakers and local populations in South Asia, such as Dravidian speakers [14], the genetic contributions from early Indo-Iranian speakers to the modern South Asians would be underestimated. Therefore, to address these issues, genetic studies on populations that are likely to be the first descendants from west Eurasia into the Indian subcontinent are critical.",
            "Located in the northernmost outpost of South Asia, at the brink of the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor, the Hindu Kush range of northern Pakistan has long been considered as a conduit for the migration of early Indo-Iranian speakers (often referred to as pastoralist groups from the Steppe) [2,15] who were likely pioneers for the introduction of IE languages into South Asia [2,16]. Distinct Indo-Aryan dialect complexes, natively spoken in this region and known as \u201cDardic,\u201d were broadly assumed to be the independent surviving remnants of the ancestors of Indo-Iranian speakers [17]. Anthropological and genetic studies have suggested that settlers in northern Pakistan, such as the Kalash and Kho, were historically and culturally isolated from their urbanized surroundings in South Asia and other extant Eurasian populations [18,19], thus probably representing early offshoots of the Vedic Aryans [20]. Moreover, the other major languages in this range, i.e., the eastern Iranians, can be traced back to Avestan scriptures [21], implying antiquity and long-term occupation of these IE language bearers along the northwestern region of South Asia. Therefore, genetic investigation into Dardic and Iranian speakers residing in northern Pakistan could help to elucidate the initial expansion of IE languages into South Asia if it can be linked to the Bronze Age demographic dispersals.",
            "In this study, we sequenced maternally transmitted mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from 213 Indo-Iranian language speakers (53 Iranian and 160 Dardic speakers) from the Hindu Kush mountain valleys along the northwestern periphery of Pakistan (Fig.1). Together with published ancient and modern mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data and radiocarbon-dated human bones and archeological artifacts from this region, we explored whether there are significant genetic contributions from the Eurasian Steppe in northern Pakistanis along with the expansion of IE languages.",

            "Blood samples from 213 IE speakers (193 new and 20 reported in our previous study [22]) that covered major Indo-Iranian-speaking regions in northern Pakistan were collected (Fig.1). All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Written and signed informed consent was obtained from each participant before the study. Furthermore, a total of 19,568 mtDNA sequences covering native IE speakers from west Eurasia and Asia were obtained, including 6339 complete mitogenomes (TableS1) and 13,229 partial mtDNA (with control and partial coding region information) (TableS2). Published archeological data from northern Pakistan (N=\u2009116, TableS3) starting from the Bronze Age (5102\u2009\u00b1\u200960 to 310\u2009\u00b1\u200930bp), which mainly include radiocarbon-dated human bones, were also included for comparisons.

We obtained the variants for each sequence relative to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (NC_012920.1) [24] and assigned them to specific haplogroups using PhyloTree Build 17 (http://phylotree.org/) [25]. The haplogroup results were further confirmed using HaploGrep [26]. We followed the general criteria of PhyloTree Build 17 for assigning new haplogroup and sub-haplogroup statuses [25], and searched for diagnostic motifs for those new branches using our in-house database (TablesS1andS2) (19,781 mtDNA sequences) to further assess genetic affinity between geographic regions (TableS4).

For the mtDNA data sequences obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) [27], the kinship of individuals in their respective families was checked to ensure that the samples represented a random population survey. SPSS v20 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for regression (REGR), correspondence analysis, and admixture estimation with the weighted least squares method [28].",
            "Phylogenetic trees of the mitochondrial genome sequences were reconstructed based on contemporary and ancient mitogenome sequences by mt-Phyl software (https://sites.google.com/site/mtphyl/home) and checked manually. Coalescent ages of haplogroups were calculated by different methods, including the rho (\u03c1) and standard error (\u03c3) methods [29,30], which provide unbiased and overlapping estimates of clade age [31], as well as the Bayesian estimate by BEAST. Branches with\u00a0\u22653 sequences were considered for age estimations. Substitution rates at complete coding regions and synonymous positions of coding regions from previous study [32]\u00a0were adopted. The protein coding regions with synonymous positions were selected for coalescent time estimations utilizing the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach implemented in BEAST v1.5.2 [33] with the best-fit model. For west Eurasian haplogroups, we obtained all contemporary (TableS6) and ancient mtDNA sequences (TableS7) from the Mitomap (https://www.mitomap.org) [34], European Nucleotide Archives (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), ancient human mitochondrial genome database (AmtDB) [35], and available literature for phylogeographic reconstructions.",
            "Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) which showing the changes of effective population size (Ne) through time were reconstructed using BEAST v1.5.2 [33]. To circumvent the confounding effects of common homoplasy in the hypervariable control region and to focus on neutrally evolving sites, 13 protein coding regions (spanning nucleotides 576\u201316,023 of mitogenomes with the reverse complementedND6gene, thus ensuring the same read direction for all genes in the sequences) were utilized for BSP analysis, as described in previous studies [36]. The best-fit model (HKY\u2009+\u2009G) was selected with Model test (v3.7) [37] for all BEAST-related analyses. A strict molecular clock with the fixed rate of 1.691E\u22128 substitutions per site per year was chosen [38] and was further evaluated with an uncorrelated relaxed clock model. Each MCMC simulation was run for 40,000,000 generations and sampled every 4000 generations, with the first 40,000 generations discarded as burn-in. After each cycle, the runs were checked with Tracer v1.5 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) to confirm convergence and sufficient effective population size (ESS\u2009\u2265\u2009200) was considered for all relevant parameters of traces. The BEAST trees were reconstructed using DensiTree [39].",
            "Based on the obtained mitogenome information, all 213 IE speakers in northern Pakistan could be allocated into haplogroups derived from non-African lineages M, N, and R. Most individuals in northern Pakistan (66.19%, 141/213) were affiliated to haplogroups HV, JT, and U (TableS8), which are reported to be prevalent in west Eurasians [40\u201342], at a much higher rate than that of other South Asian populations (24.9%) based on the 1KGP [27], Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) [43], and Bengali population data [13]. The distribution of unique diagnostic motifs of the haplogroups defined in our study is shared across Eurasia; however, some substitutions were more frequent in South Asians (TableS4), implying the consistent presence and de novo origination of these lineages in north Pakistan after differentiation\u00a0from western Eurasian counterparts.",
            "To further investigate the genetic relationship between the northern Pakistani populations and surroundings, a total of 19,757 samples from 294 population studies were analyzed covering IE and other language family-speaking populations from northern Pakistan and its surroundings, including Europe, the Middle East and\u00a0Caucasus, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia (Fig.1). The PCA plot based on haplogroup frequencies showed a general differentiation in IE-speaking populations between South Asia and Europe, with South Asian IE speakers distributed together with the Dravidians (Figs.2AandS1), consistent with the genetic admixture of these two linguistic groups observed in previous studies [14]. Haplogroups ubiquitous in present-day west Eurasians (e.g., mainly the descendants of haplogroups HV and JT) contributed most to PC1, whereas haplogroups prevalent in South Asia contributed to PC2 (Fig.2B). The association of the western Eurasian components with present-day South Asians is further supported by the correspondence analysis (Fig.S2). Moreover, some components, e.g., U5a sub-haplogroups that were prevalent in the Steppe during the Bronze Age [10], also contributed to PC2, implying potential genetic contributions from the Steppe into South Asia, including northern Pakistan.",

            "In comparison to IE speakers in India, populations residing in the northwestern regions of the subcontinent, including the Kho and Pashtuns in northern Pakistan, were more akin to populations from the west, especially those from the Central Asian Steppe, e.g., the Pamiris and Tajiks (Fig.2). This could be attributed to less deeply rooted Asian-specific lineages, such as macrohaplogroup \u201cM\u201d and its derivatives, in our northern Pakistani samples (18.3%) than in the southern subcontinent populations [27,43] (47%), as well as substantial haplogroup sharing (e.g., HV and J) between northern Pakistanis and Central Asians (Fig.S3). These affinities would have been established since ancient times, as evident from archaeological studies documenting ancient population movements between west Eurasia and the Indus peripheral region [44]. Further evidence comes from the gradual decrease in west Eurasian component from north Pakistan to the southeastern Indian subcontinent based on admixture estimation (TableS9). Moreover, the diversity indices of those lineages in northern Pakistan, which are prevalent in western Eurasians, show higher nucleotide diversities in northern Pakistan than in the southern subcontinent, implying longer differentiation of these lineages in the northwestern subcontinent (TableS10). These results together suggest that the Indo-Iranian populations in northern Pakistan retained more genetic components from western Eurasia in comparison with the IE-speaking populations in the southern Indian subcontinent.",
            "Based on phylogeographic analysis of all available mitogenome data, we updated the phylogeographic status of the western Eurasian lineages in South Asia (TableS4) and identified 29 haplogroups which are prevalent in South Asia, and would have differentiated independently with derived branches in this region (Fig.S4). Five of these\u00a0haplogroups, which had been\u00a0reported in our previous work [22] (i.e., H2a1a3, J2b1a7a, R0a5a, U2e1h1, and U4a1f) were also reassessed together with the new haplogroup branches. Age estimations utilizing different mtDNA mutation rates and different methods indicated that the ages of these 29 haplogroups ranged from 10.14 to 0.5\u2009kya (TableS11), with most (20/29) <5\u2009kya old in South Asia (TableS11and Fig.S4), a time subsequent to the major Bronze Age processes occurring in the Eurasian Steppe, e.g., eastern extensions of IE and related cultures advancing from Yamnaya about 3000bc[2]. Specifically, among the 20 haplogroups that can be traced back to the Bronze Age period, 12 were distributed exclusively in northern Pakistan and 4 were ubiquitous in both the north and southern mainland (Fig.S4), accounting for ~23% of our northern Pakistani samples. Considering the restrictive distribution of these haplogroups in north Pakistan and the surroundings, it is possible that these haplogroups differentiated independently in this area. Therefore, the ages of these haplogroups would reflect the upper bound of their arrival times into north Pakistan. These results thus suggest substantial genetic contributions to the northern Pakistani gene pool since the beginning of the Bronze Age. This finding was further supported by Bayesian-based analysis, which illustrated that the majority of these west Eurasian lineages coalesced 5\u2009kya in north Pakistan (Fig.S5). Interestingly, this extensive genetic contributions from west Eurasia during the Bronze Age is in agreement with the substantial settlements evidenced by the increasing number of archaeological remains in northern Pakistan with14C dates from the beginning of the Bronze Age (TableS3and Fig.S6), which are broadly interpreted as remnants of Indo-Iranian speakers from the region [45].",
            "Further analysis, together with ancient mitogenome data, was conducted to assess past genetic contact between northern Pakistan and western Eurasia. Some haplogroups were found to have ancestors or sister lineages predominantly in the Middle East and the Caucasus (i.e., R0a5a, T1a2c, R2e, U7a3b1, and J1b1b1d) (TableS7and Fig.S4), reflecting a likely genetic connection between northern Pakistan and the Middle East [46]. Similarly, several lineages (i.e., W3b2, I4b1, J1d7, U7a6, U7a2c, U7a3a1, U7b3, T2o, and T2d1b3) showed even more complex branching, with siblings found in the Middle East as well as further north in the Steppe, but mostly lacking upstream branches from the southern subcontinent (Fig.S4). Given the existence of genetic introgression from Anatolian farmers into Yamnaya ancestries [5], and the lack of Anatolian ancestry in South Asians after ~6000bc[10], it is likely that these lineages would have been introduced into north Pakistanis by Steppe pastoralists, who accepted genetic contributions from Anatolian farmers. However, the possibility that the bearers of those haplogroups were early Iranian farmers [46] who further mixed with pastoralists in the BMAC [10] cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the absence of haplogroup K1 in our data, which is often associated with Neolithic dispersals from Anatolia [47], further supports the above admixture scenarios. Other haplogroups that would have been transported with these past genetic contacts, e.g., H5a1r and especially J2b1a7a, with ancestor types and sibling lineages in Europe, would have moved from the Europe and reached the Hindu Kush region, probably during the Bronze Age onward [22].",
            "We further focused on haplogroups displaying direct connections between northern Pakistan and the Steppe region. Results indicated that haplogroup U2e1h1 (age 7.06\u20139.55\u2009kya), which had ancestor types distributed in the Steppe region, likely originated therein. One possible explanation for the prevalence in northern Pakistan with coalescent ages\u2009>7\u2009kya could be its presence in this region for more than 7000 years, and advent to northern Pakistan before the early Bronze Age Yamnaya expansion [12]. However, whether this kind of haplogroups are part of the common Eurasian-shared ancestry and remain visible in north Pakistan through genetic drift or originated elsewhere ~7\u20139\u2009kya and dispersed into this region during the Bronze Age cannot be ruled out. Given the uncertainty of their expansion time into northern Pakistan, it is difficult to speculate whether U2e1h1 expanded with the spread of IE languages during the Bronze Age.",
            "Differently, other haplogroups, with coalescent ages estimated since about 5\u2009kya, such as J1b1a1f (age 2.63\u20133.53\u2009kya, one outlier 12.07\u2009kya was disregarded), U4a1f (age 2.52\u20135.00\u2009kya), and H2b1 (2.35\u20135.25\u2009kya) (TableS11), have ancestor and sister lineages found in Europe and the Steppe region (Fig.S4). These haplogroups, especially J1b1a1f and U4a1f which showed independent differentiations in north Pakistan, thus would have been introduced into the northern Pakistani Indo-Iranian-speaker gene pool after 5\u2009kya, consistent with the arrival of Indo-Iranian-speaking groups in northern South Asia during the Bronze Age (~2300\u20131200bc) [12]. Thus, these haplogroups could be considered as genetic legacies of IEs from the Steppe region. Additional support comes from haplogroup U4a1f, whose ancestor type (U4a1) was found in Neolithic samples from Europe and, importantly, in Yamnaya samples from the western Steppe (Fig.S4). Similarly, haplogroup W3a1a4 (age 2.35\u20135.25\u2009kya) and sub-haplogroups of W3a1b (e.g., W3a1b1, age 2.63\u20136\u2009kya, distributed in both northern Pakistan and the southern subcontinent), with the sister type W3a1a found in ancient Yamnaya samples, could also have Yamnaya-related origination. Other haplogroups, e.g., H2a1a3 (age 0.88\u20133.00\u2009kya) with ancestor node in the eastern and central Steppe, likely suggest dispersals into northern Pakistan along with the expansion of Bronze Age cultures such as the Andronovo (a late Bronze Age culture also associated with early Indo-Iranian groups) (Fig.3A). These haplogroups, viz., J1b1a1f, U4a1f, H2a1a3, W3a1a4, and W3a1b subbranches, can therefore trace their ancestry to the Steppe region and would have descended from populations therein during the Bronze Age (Fig.3A, B). As their coalescent ages in northern Pakistan\u00a0and the radiocarbon dates of their ancient Eurasian counterparts (Fig.3B) fit well with the timing of the spread of IE languages into South Asia, the most probable explanation would be that these lineages were introduced into the gene pool of northern Pakistani Indo-Iranian speakers from the Steppe region from the beginning of the Bronze Age, at least according to currently available evidence.",

            "Interestingly, the IE genetic legacy from the Steppe region, i.e., H2a1a3, J1b1a1f, U4a1f, and subbranch of W3a1, accounted for 8.4% of our northern Pakistani samples, which is much more pronounced than that in the southern subcontinent populations (~1.7%) in the 1KGP [27] and HGDP [43] data sets. This implies a greater genetic contribution from the Steppe region to the northern Pakistanis than to the southern South Asians. One explanation could be the influence of demographic processes (e.g., genetic drift or founder effect) resulting in the retention of a greater genetic legacy from IE speakers in northern Pakistanis. However, considering the closer genetic affinity between the southern subcontinent Indo-Iranian and Dravidian speakers (Fig.S1), it is more likely that this difference is due to the southward migration of IE speakers via northern Pakistan, during which they assimilated maternal genetic components from contemporary non-IE-speaking groups, consistent with substantial ancestry from the Steppe in present-day South Asians [10]. This scenario finds further support from the southward dispersals of Steppe legacy of IEs in northern Pakistan in our analysis. For example, W3a1b, with root types found in both modern individuals and individuals of prehistorical and early historical periods in the Swat Valley, northern Pakistan [10], had subbranches W3a1b1, W3a1b2, and W3a1b3 that arose in situ in the southern subcontinent, especially India (Table1and Fig.3A, C). The estimated ages of sub-haplogroups of W3a1b (W3a1b1: 3.53\u2009kya, W3a1b2: 4.14\u2009kya) were further confirmed with BEAST estimations (Table1) and echoed the arrival time of IE speakers in India in the late Bronze Age (~1500bc). Therefore, the genetic legacy of IE speakers in northern Pakistan also contributed to the gene pools of the southern subcontinent populations along with IE language expansion, indicating that the southward IE language expansion was not simply mediated by cultural diffusion. These results highlight the corridor role of the Hindu Kush region of northern Pakistan in genetic introgression from the Steppe to South Asia during the Bronze Age, which would have been mediated by the southward expansion of IE speakers, consistent with views from archaeological and linguistic studies [17,19,44,45].",

            "BSP analysis was carried out to elucidate the impact of Bronze Age Eurasian migrations on the population dynamics of South Asia. Results indicated an increase in the effective population size (Ne) for northern Pakistani populations from ~18\u2009kya (Fig.4A), although relatively flat, likely facilitated by the climatic improvements after the last glacial maximum. TheNeof northern Pakistanis remained stable during the postglacial period and even during the Neolithic, in agreement with recent reports on modern and ancient genomes from South Asia [9,48]. In brief, our results indicated that the Neolithic expansion into South Asia from 8\u2009kya did not strongly affect the population size in northern Pakistan, thus suggesting any major genetic influx from the Iranian plateau during the Neolithic into the region to be unlikely. Surprisingly, a population decrease was observed in the northern Pakistanis after 5\u2009kya, which lasted until 1.02\u2009kya (Fig.4A). This differs from the signal observed from Bronze Age lineages and the genetic legacy of IE speakers from the Steppe, which displayed intensive growth from 5\u2009kya (Fig.4B, C) and likely reflected a rapid population expansion of pastoralist groups from the Steppe after their migration into northern Pakistan. These BSP trends were reevaluated utilizing a relaxed clock model using the same data sets, with highly similar results, but with less intense population decline trend in northern Pakistan since 5\u2009kya (Fig.S7). To further avoid any potential artifacts arising in BSP methodology [49], we calculated Tajima\u2019sDand obtained a positive value (0.63550), indicative of population shrinkage in this region (TableS10) and lending support to the BSP results. One explanation for this decline may be the depletion of natural resources or habitat in the region after the arrival of Steppe pastoralists ~5.5\u2009kya, which may have led to a population decrease [44,50]. However, the influence of\u00a0other factors, such as social structure changes, population size fluctuations, natural selection, and quaternary climatic oscillations between the northern hemisphere and South Asian monsoon [44], should not be ignored. More studies should be carried out to confirm this population decrease.",

            "In summary, based on available archeological and high-resolution mitogenome data from northwestern Pakistan, especially from Iranian and Dardic populations, who are suggested to be the surviving traces of early Indo-Iranian groups, we identified the genetic contributions of different dispersals from west Eurasia into northern Pakistan during the Bronze Age onward. Importantly, we identified five haplogroups as the genetic legacy of IE speakers from the Eurasian Steppe, likely dispersed along with the migration of IE-speaking populations during the Bronze Age into northern Pakistan, thus implying that IE language expansion into South Asia was not simply mediated by cultural diffusion. This migration contributed 8.4% of the gene pool of northern Pakistani IE speakers, suggesting this demographic connection, which is a possible source of IE language diffusion, could be one part of the complex demographic history of the region. Our results also provide implications on the two main hypotheses of IE language origination, viz. Anatolia and Steppe hypotheses. Considering that Steppe components were observed in all Indo-Iranian groups in northern Pakistan in our study, as well as in other regions in South Asia [10], while lineages possibly representing the genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers, e.g., R2e, K1, were either absent or not found in all of the IE-speaking groups in northern Pakistan, our results lend more support to the Steppe hypothesis, at least from a matrilineal perspective. Furthermore, these IE speakers, as evidenced by the genetic legacy identified here, also moved southward and contributed genetically, though to a rather limited extent, to the Indian subcontinent, suggesting northern Pakistan as a corridor in the spread of IE languages during the Bronze Age dispersals into South Asia. Since our study is only based on mtDNA data, which only reflect maternal histories of populations, more investigations based on genome-wide data are\u00a0also needed to intensively dissect the expansion of IE speakers into South Asia.",

            "ABSTRACT",
            "The historical province of Dobruja, located in southeastern Romania, has experienced intense human population movement, invasions, and conflictual episodes during the Middle Ages, being an important intersection point between Asia and Europe. The most informative source of maternal population histories is the complete mitochondrial genome of archaeological specimens, but currently, there is insufficient ancient DNA data available for the medieval period in this geographical region to complement the archaeological findings. In this study, we reconstructed, by using Next Generation Sequencing, the entire mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of six medieval individuals neglectfully buried in a multiple burial from Capidava necropolis (Dobruja), some presenting signs of a violent death. Six distinct maternal lineages (H11a1, U4d2, J1c15, U6a1a1, T2b, and N1a3a) with different phylogenetic background were identified, pointing out the heterogeneous genetic aspect of the analyzed medieval group. Using population genetic analysis based on high-resolution mitochondrial data, we inferred the genetic affinities of the available medieval dataset from Capidava to other ancient Eurasian populations. The genetic data were integrated with the archaeological and anthropological information in order to sketch a small, local piece of the mosaic that is the image of medieval European population history.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "Over thousands of years, the Lower Danube Basin witnessed striking social and cultural changes and several waves of human population migrations that have contributed to the shaping of the current European genetic landscape. Large-scale studies on the ancient DNA (aDNA) preserved in human archaeological remains, a direct proof of mankind\u2019s historical past, have brought to light significant genetic evidence to answer some puzzling questions regarding complex past interactions. Most of them shed light on the genomic history of different European regions from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age, whereas the genetic heritage mirrored in more recent time transects remains partly obscured due to the limited number of analyzed samples and/or populations. This scenario reflects the situation of southeastern Europe. Based on the genomes of four prehistoric samples from Romania, Gonz\u00e1lez Fortes et al. revealed that the Neolithization process in this area relied on the movement of both people and ideas. The analysis and interpretation of genome-wide aDNA data from more than 200 individuals inhabiting southeastern Europe between 12,000 and 500 BC, showed that this geographical region \u201cserved as a genetic contact zone between east and west over thousands of years\u201d. This pattern was also observed in a small medieval group of individuals from southeastern Romania (Dobruja). The genetic connections to Central Asia were reflected by the presence of the N9a haplotype in 2 out of 10 successfully analyzed samples. Evidence from present-day maternal haplogroup diversity in the historical provinces of Romania showed that the Asian influence in Dobruja is greater than in the other regions, and suggested that the Carpathian Arch might have had an influential role in migration patterns. Other findings from ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) research revealed the contribution of Hungarian Conquerors to the gene pool of the Carpathian Basin and suggested that most probably they descended from steppe nomadic people. However, the archaeogenetic picture of medieval southeastern Europe is far from being complete.",
            "The aim of the current study is to catch a glimpse into the maternal population history of the Lower Danube Basin by integrating full-length mitochondrial data with archaeological and anthropological evidence of a small group of medieval individuals (C58 archaeological complex) discovered in southeastern Romania (Capidava necropolis). This study is an attempt in understanding why these individuals were collectively buried in a particular fashion, which contrasts with the typical Christian medieval funerary practices observed at the same site, to evaluate the levels of variability within this group, and the relationships to other ancient populations from Eurasia.",
            "Capidava fortress (Capidava village, Constan\u021ba County), a civil and military center after the Roman conquest, stands on the right bank of the Danube, halfway between H\u00e2r\u0219ova (Carsium fortress) and Cernavod\u0103 (Axiopolis fortress), the road linking the localities passing by the walls of the fortress. The first archaeological surveys in the Capidava area started at the beginning of the 20th century and were initiated by Vasile P\u00e2rvan and Grigore Florescu. Archaeological research in and near the Capidava fortress has started in 1924 and continues without major interruptions to date, but until recently the biological material discovered here was not fully exploited. The archaeological excavations have highlighted dramatic changes of the fortress structure since it was built at the end of the third century AD. At the end of the 6th century AD, after the Huns burned down the fortress, a small quadrilateral fort occupying the southern quarter of the precinct was built. A century later, amid the attacks of Avars and Slavs, the fortress was completely destroyed and abandoned by the last troops overseeing the area. In the 10th century another wave of destruction and rebuilding was recorded, this time the walls being reconstructed following the initial pattern used in Roman times. During the 10th-11th centuries, the Lower Danube Basin was politically part of the Byzantine Empire. This was a troubled period, with complex interactions between several populations (Bulgarians, Kievans, and Turkics). As Capidava fortress is placed on the fringe of the Danubian Byzantine Empire, many migratory populations used this settlement in their passage. Due to lack of solid archaeological evidence, particularly absence of any grave goods, the individuals from the C58 archaeological complex, the subject of this study, cannot be associated to any invasive ethnic groups or to any local populations (Bulgarians, Vlachs, Byzantines etc.).",
            "RESULTS",
            "Results",
            "Archaeological context and osteological analysis",
            "The assemblage of human skeletal remains belonging to the ten individuals was placed in a multiple burial pit (C58) and was not arranged according to the Christian burial customs of the medieval period, as observed in the majority of the graves from this archaeological site (simple, quadrilateral inhumation graves, generally west-east oriented skeletons in dorsal decubitus). The skeletons were found on the bottom of an elliptical pit, with no artifacts present (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2). It is highly likely that the individuals were buried reasonably soon after death, as they were partially articulated, spatial position of body segments was kept after skeletonization, no animal predation marks were observed on bones, and no secondary disturbances were detected in the stratigraphy. The C58 archaeological complex is located near similar structures (circular pits) with potential uses as storage, waste disposal or loess exploitation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1). Radiocarbon dating results show that the analyzed funerary complexes were not contemporaneous, the C58 multiple burial pit being older (773\u2013906\u2009cal. AD) than the C143 single grave (962\u20131040\u2009cal. AD). Previous radiocarbon dating is available for Cap-M4 (880\u2013990\u2009cal. AD) an individual buried according to Christian funerary custom in terrace B of the necropolis.",
            "The anthropological analysis revealed that the skeletal material from the C58 grave can be attributed to a minimum number of ten individuals. All results pertaining to the osteological analysis are summarized in the Supplementary Table\u00a0S1. The skeletons were conserved in proportions ranging from 23 to 86%, and missing osteological inventory was absent exclusively due to taphonomic reasons. Case descriptions are only briefly outlined here because an osteological catalog for all individuals recovered since 2010 until present will be subsequently published together with a more thorough analysis of the archaeological contexts for this site. The skeletal material is composed of seven adult and three subadult individuals. There were six adults for which the sex could be estimated based on the cranial features and the morphology of the pelvic bones. Sex distribution is rather imbalanced, as four of the individuals displayed male typical morphological features (Cap-C58-1, Cap-C58-2, Cap-C58-3, and Cap-C58-5) and the remaining two exhibited skeletal markers which indicate that they were probably females (Cap-C58-6, and Cap-C58-11). This small group of individuals is pretty diverse in terms of age since only the old adult category is absent. The male individuals recovered from the C58 funerary assemblage exhibited signs of violent traumas (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3). The bioarchaeological analysis revealed the presence of two antemortem injuries on the scapula of two individuals, both with infection signs, and four perimortem wounds, one of which was identified on the posterior lateral epicondyle of C58-5s\u2019 left humerus. Each of the C58-1, C58-2, and C58-5 male individuals displayed one perimortem trauma on the frontal bone, two of which were sharp force traumas (C58-1 and C58-5) and one blunt force trauma (C58-2).",
            "Samples and sequencing",
            "We successfully reconstructed the complete mitochondrial genomes for all six individuals from the Capidava multiple burial selected for molecular analysis. The bioinformatics processing of the raw reads reveals that the resulted sequences for all analyzed samples reach standard quality requested to assure the authenticity of the NGS data. The details of NGS data for each sample are summarized in the Supplementary Table\u00a0S2. Using hybridization capture in solution combined with high-throughput sequencing, six whole mitochondrial genomes were generated with the depth of average coverage ranging from 69x to 176x. The DNA damage profile of the samples and average fragment length were used as criteria of authentication in an iterative probabilistic approach that allows to estimate human contamination and to reconstruct the endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. The rates of cytosine deamination at the 5\u2032 end of the molecules were high, varying from 24.7% to 41.3%. The resulted mtDNA fragments are short, with a median length of 57.87 base pairs (bp) which ranges in the typical size length for aDNA. In addition, the percentage of possible present-day human contamination was evaluated in order to further asses the authenticity of the ancient mitochondrial genomes. No significant levels of contamination were detected, as shown in the Supplementary Table\u00a0S2.",
            "The mutation patterns revealed by the analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes of six samples from the C58 archaeological complex can be classified into five macro-haplogroups (H, J, N, T, and U) (Supplementary Table\u00a0S3). The maternal genetic composition of the Capidava multiple burial appears to consist of six different west Eurasian haplogroups (H11a1, J1c15, N1a3a, T2b, U4d2, and U6a1a1) with no east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages detected.",
            "Phylogenetic analyses",
            "A total number of 306 complete human mtDNA records (Supplementary Table\u00a0S4) were found to match the maternal lineages of the investigated medieval individuals and were used for the construction of phylogenetic networks in order to outline the geographic affinities and genetic relationships of the Capidava multiple burial individuals. A small number of equivalent haplotypes from literature could not be properly aligned due to incomplete sequences, and these were not used in the phylogenetic networks.",
            "MtDNA sequences of medieval Capidava multiple burial were depicted in six Median-Joining Networks. Samples falling within the same sub-haplogroup as those studied are emphasized by a blue circle. The networks are color-coded according to the \u201cTraits block\u201d of the Nexus-format alignments. Three different attributes (represented by three different colors) were used in order to discern between the samples analyzed in this study and other present-day or historical samples. Red nodes correspond to the Capidava samples, orange circles represent ancient samples and the modern ones are colored green. Black circles represent hypothetical haplotypes. The sizes of the circles are proportional to the frequency of each haplotype; the smallest colored circles representing only one sample. The numbers of cross lines in the branches between adjacent nodes denote number of mutations. The length of the branches is not relevant as they were adjusted to fit the page. The closest samples to those studied are labeled with GenBank accession number and their geographical origin.",
            "The increased level of resolution of full length mtDNA data allowed for the identification of direct links among closely related ancient and modern mitogenomes and for the precise assignment of geographic affinities. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three C58 haplogroups, H11a1 (Fig.\u00a01), U4d2 (Fig.\u00a02), and J1c15 (Fig.\u00a03), are ubiquitous in Eurasia, while the T2b clade is widely spread across Europe (Fig.\u00a04). The closest sequence matches elucidated using median-joining networks pointed to geographic affinities restricted to the Middle East in case of N1a3a (Fig.\u00a05) and to the Mediterranean region for U6a1a1 (Fig.\u00a06).",
            "Population genetics analyses",
            "Pairwise genetic distances were calculated based on the complete mitochondrial genomes of 18 ancient Eurasian populations, including the medieval Capidava group (Supplementary Table\u00a0S5). Due to the fact that our investigated population is small (six samples) we grouped it together with four of the formerly published medieval samples from this necropolis. The medieval population from Capidava showed the lowest distances from four ancient populations: Bronze Age population of the Balkan Peninsula (Balkans_BA) (FST\u2009=\u2009\u22120.0348), Srubnaya (SRU) (FST\u2009=\u2009\u22120.02367), Poltavka-Potapovka (PBA) (FST\u2009=\u2009\u22120.01677), and Hungarian Conquerors (HUN_Conq) (FST\u2009=\u2009\u22120.01325); these values were not significant (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Five ancient groups (SBA, Scand, NEN, HUN_BA, and BBC) appeared most distant to the individuals in our dataset, displaying significant differentiation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a07). The exact FST values and their corresponding p-values are listed in the Supplementary Table\u00a0S6.",
            "These genetic distances were visualized by displaying the linearized Slatkin FST values on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot (Fig.\u00a08). The resulted plot reflects the extremely tight connection between the ROU-med and Bronze Age population from the Pontic-Caspian steppe (Late Bronze Age Srubnaya culture and its ancestors Potapovka and Poltavka). The investigated medieval dataset also shows strong affinities to the Bronze Age population from the Balkans and to the Hungarian Conquerors, groups which are geographically close to the medieval population from Romania. Near Eastern Neolithic, Sintashta-Andronovo, and Bell Beaker seem to be the most distant populations relative to the Capidava group.",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "The analysis and interpretation of the available bioarchaeological data provides some evidence regarding past human interaction patterns and mortuary practices, while genetic analysis points out biological relationships among individuals. However, it is only possible to speculate about the reasons for which the C58 individuals, who died at roughly the same time, were buried together in such a special and rare funerary context. They showed no clear pattern of organization which suggests that they were rather disposed of into the pit, as opposed to ritual deposition, possible due to haste and/or lack of consideration for the dead. In contrast, previously published medieval Capidava samples, and yet unpublished samples were individually buried according to Christian rituals with few associated bronze artifacts. The pathological conditions identified on these human remains (dental enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, dental disease, periosteal inflammation, and osteolytic lesions on the vertebrae) possibly reflect the poor life quality of this group of individuals. When comparing the presence of pathological features between the individuals from the C58 complex and the ones from the rest of the necropolis, a slight increase in the incidence of stress indicators can be seen. Cribra orbitalia has an incidence of 20% in the C58 group and 17% in the necropolis group, while porotic hyperostosis occurs in 50% of the individuals from the C58 complex and in only 7% of the individuals from the necropolis. Linear enamel hypoplasia is present in 18% of the individuals from the necropolis, while in the C58 complex, it occurs in 10% of the cases. It is very likely that they had experienced one or more of the following: nutritional deficiencies, physiological stress during childhood, repetitive physical activity, and low immunological status. With regard to trauma and fractures, 8% of the individuals from the necropolis group suffered cranial trauma, while a much higher incidence, 30%, can be seen in the C58 complex. All adults show mild signs of osteoarthritis, mainly on the long bones of the upper and lower limbs, which can be associated with moderate physical activity during their lifetime. The marginal social status (e.g. outsiders, heretics, prisoners, slaves, poor, etc.) of this group at the time and place of their deaths seems a reasonable explanation when correlating the inconsiderate burial with the observed pathologies. The pattern of physical trauma observed here indicates a violent death for nearly half of the individuals, all of them males, which might be the result of some kind of skirmish. A higher frequency of skeletal trauma in males in comparison to females is not unexpected, because they were usually involved in more physically challenging and dangerous activities than females. The prevalence of frontal craniofacial injuries determined in all analyzed male individuals could be a consequence of an imbalanced fatal physical confrontation. This injury pattern indicates that these individuals were not attacked from behind (execution style). Cuts on the humerus and rib of Cap-C58-5 suggest he might have been involved in a physical struggle. Skeletal evidence of deliberate interpersonal violence was previously recorded, being linked to different historical periods such as Neolithic multiple and collective graves from Germany, a Copper Age mass grave from the territory of Croatia, and Early Iron Age settlements from Dobruja. The number of similar cases that date to the medieval period is limited to few notable examples. For instance, the first attempt at identifying the reasons for the violent death of late medieval individuals buried in a mass grave from the University Square (Bucharest, Romania) was recently documented. Comparable examples to the analyzed sample set in terms of demographic profiles (high number of women and children) were best explained by raids, attacks that usually result in killing everyone encountered. The disorganized body positions and the absence of religious rites specific to the medieval period observed in the C58 complex suggest that these individuals were perhaps outsiders (geographical, social or religious), unwanted or without rights in the local community whose representatives are not evident, at this point, in the adjacent necropolis.",
            "A very similar multiple burial was discovered in the proximity of Capidava fortress in the 1959 archaeological campaign by Florescu et al. and published three years later. The exact location of the multiple burial and the spatial relationship to the C58 burial cannot currently be accurately identified based on the published landmarks. This grave contains, according to the authors, a minimum number of nine individuals, similarly disposed of as the remains in C58, 8 adults and 1 child with possible supplementary remains belonging to one or more infants. Analyses concerning sex, age at death and traumas of these individuals were not recorded in this or ulterior publications. Nevertheless, a small paragraph pertaining to the position of the skeletal remains of a child from this grave (1959) raises the hypothesis that it may have been decapitated. In contrast to the multiple burial discussed in the present paper, the 1959 burial contained also fragments of metallic armour used in the archaeological dating of the context at 9th-10th century AD. The 1959 multiple burial human remains were not available for genetic analyses. The presence of two similar archaeological contexts dated to approximately the same age, by different means, seems to hint to a period of local turmoil and vulnerability for local and/or transiting groups.",
            "The nucleotide substitution patterns displayed by the complete mitochondrial genome of each C58 individual, the absence of identical haplotypes amongst them, show the lack of close maternal relationships between the studied samples. Other kinds of biological relationships (e.g. paternal) cannot be excluded. Four individuals (three subadults and one female) were not selected for aDNA analysis because of their poor preservation and absence of teeth.",
            "None of the haplotypes present in the multiple burial individuals matches the other five whole mitochondrial genomes found in the previously published samples (Supplementary Table\u00a0S5) or the haplogroups that were identified by the analysis of the control region sequences in the other five individuals previously published. These two groups of individuals which have been discovered in the same site, but in different archaeological contexts (C58 Information Center point and individuals from B terrace) share two macro-haplogroups, namely N and U. The higher level of classification based on complete mtDNA data revealed that the derivative lineages clustered under N macro-haplogroups are distinct (N1a3a: Cap-C58-9; N9a9: Cap-M9 and Cap-M11) and have different phylogenetic backgrounds. Two lineages descending from the common ancestor U were found in each set of individuals (U4d2 and U6a1a1 were detected in the multiple burial samples, while U5a1c2a and U3a were identified in the previously published samples). Derivative sub-branches of haplogroups J and T which are commonly distributed across Europe were exclusively found in the multiple burial individuals of all genetically processed samples from this necropolis. Haplogroup H, the most widely spread and diverse maternal lineage in Europe was observed in lower frequencies among the samples from C58 complex than in the other medieval samples from Capidava. The influence of the maternal familial relationships on the funerary ritual is suggested by the presence of identical haplotypes only in adjacently buried individuals (single graves).",
            "All the haplogroups identified in the ancient samples from this study are also present in the modern Romanian population as shown by the mtDNA control region sequences of 714 Romanians. The only matching haplotype is T2b which was detected in modern samples from all historical provinces of Romania, except Dobruja. Most probably the other haplotypes could not be detected in modern samples due to the small resolution of the control region data and/or to low frequencies of these haplotypes in the modern population. Of all haplogroups described in this study, the most frequent one in the modern Romanian population is J1c, which is most common in present-day Dobruja individuals. Haplogroups H11 and U4 are more frequent in modern Walachia and Moldavia than in Transylvania, while N1a is absent from the Transylvanian set.",
            "The Cap-C58-1 sample contains all defining mutations for H11a1, a descendant subclade of the common western Eurasian H11 haplogroup, as well as a private mutation 16261\u2009T. Similar genetic profiles are currently distributed across most of the northern, central and eastern Europe and in Central Asia. H11a was identified in a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer of the Narva culture from Lithuania (Spiginas1), in a Bronze Age sample from Hungary (Rise247) and was also found associated to the Unetice culture (BZH1). H11a1 was found in a medieval sample belonging to an adult female of the Hungarian Conquest period, but it is not an exact match to the C58-1 sample (Fig.\u00a01).",
            "The U4d2 haplotype is currently distributed in some geographic areas of Eurasia, being most frequent in populations of Eastern Europe (Volga Tatars and Slavic speaking groups) and in aboriginal Siberians (Yakuts, Tuvinians, Khakassians) (Supplementary Table\u00a0S4). It has been suggested that U4d2 branch might be of Slavic origin due to its high incidence in Slavic-speaking populations and it might have expanded into Central Europe and Siberia from Eastern Europe. This haplotype includes three ancient maternally inherited genomes, all from Hungarian Conquerors. The haplotype of Cap-C58-2 contains all of the expected U4d2 diagnostic mutations aside from 16189\u2009C, and four personal transitions. The same maternal genetic signature occurs in present-day Slavic populations (Poland, Russia, and Serbia) (Fig.\u00a02).",
            "The polymorphism distinguished in the complete mtDNA sequence of Cap-C58-3 can be classified as J1c15, a derivative sub-branch of the most prevalent form (J1c) of J macro-haplogroup in present-day Europe. This specific haplotype variant is rare in modern mtDNA data and seems to be connected mainly to the Near East, more sparsely to Europe and, to our knowledge, is absent from the published ancient datasets. The detected J1c15 haplotype is most similar to a sample observed in the gene pool of Tatars inhabiting the territory of the middle Volga River (Fig.\u00a03).",
            "Mitochondrial consensus sequence of Cap-C58-6 belongs to the T2b haplogroup, a major sublineage of T2 that spread into Europe from the Near Eastern refuges. Equivalent haplotypes were found in remains from the Linear Pottery culture (LBK) in Central Europe and in an Early Neolithic skeleton from north-western Anatolia (I1099) (Fig.\u00a04). The same T2b haplotype was identified in various present-day European populations, which could indicate its European origin.",
            "N1a3a sub-branch defined by the 16201\u2009T substitution was detected in the Cap-C58-9 sample. The phylogenetic network analysis (Fig.\u00a05) reveals that the Capidava sample which lacks only the 207\u2009A defining mutation for N1a3 is most closely related to modern samples originating from Iran, Levant, and Cyprus. The current geographic distribution of this maternal lineage shows that it is mainly restricted to the Middle East, being extremely rare in central-east Europe (Romanians, Poles, Belarusians, and Tatars of the Volga-Ural region), being indicative thus of Middle Eastern genetic traces in Europeans. Ancient N1a3a haplotypes were documented in an Iron Age sample from Iran and a Middle Bronze Age individual from Lebanon.",
            "Cap-C58-5 displays the mutational motif for U6a1a1, a derived lineage nested within U6a1 which is spread from the Near East to northwestern Africa. This subclade (U6a1a1) currently occurs at high frequencies in the central-western Mediterranean range as shown in Fig.\u00a06. Its highest frequencies across the European continent are restricted to the Iberian and Italian peninsulas. This particular mitochondrial variant was not found in the published ancient mitogenomes, but other U6a haplotypes were previously reported for six Taforalt individuals attesting their preHolocene presence in the Maghreb and basal haplogroup U6 has been identified in a 35,000-year-old Homo sapiens from Romania (Muierii cave).",
            "The maternal genetic composition of the Capidava population as represented by all analyzed samples points to a mixed origin from multiple sources. The high-resolution mtDNA data of the individuals buried in single graves in the necropolis, display genetic affinities towards Central and Eastern Europe and to Central Asia. In contrast, according to the phylogenetic analysis of the C58 haplotypes, multiple connections with ancient Middle East mtDNA genomes from different historical periods were found, as well as links to the medieval Hungarian conquerors. Close genetic ties to the Conquerors were also exposed by the population genetic analysis (Figs\u00a07 and 8). It is worth noting that the medieval Hungarian samples used for genetic distances are different from those used for phylogenetic reconstruction, a fact which increases the strength of this apparent connection. It has been argued by Nepar\u00e1czki et al. that the best fitting origin of the European component identified in Hungarian Conquerors are the Late Bronze Age Srubnaya culture, and its ancestors Potapovka and Poltavka. Very tight relationships were observed between the medieval Capidava population and these Bronze Age populations of steppe origin. These data suggest that the Pontic-Caspian steppe genetic input in Eastern Europe might not be solely restricted to the Carpathian Basin.",
            "CONCL",
            "Conclusion",
            "This study provides new anthropological and genetic insights on a medieval group of individuals from southeastern Europe, collectively buried in a particular fashion that contrasts the typical Christian funerary rituals of this historical period as observed in the same necropolis. The unusual position of the human skeletal remains, associated pathologies, and the presence of traumatic injuries among the male individuals, point to interpersonal violence, poor life quality, and the careless treatment of the dead. The high diversity of mitochondrial haplogroups detected in the C58 archaeological complex (six individuals, six haplotypes) reflects the lack of close maternal relationships among individuals, and quite an intricate genetic history, as the identified subclades have diverse geographic distribution (Eurasia, Middle East, Southern Europe). The full length mitogenomic data reconstructed in this study enriches the available genetic information for the medieval period, particularly for Dobruja. All the existing mtDNA information on the medieval Capidava population provides further evidence for genetic connections to the Hungarian Conquerors, a Bronze Age population from the Balkans and Bronze Age populations of steppe origin (Srubnaya and Potapovka-Poltavka).",

            "Archaeological background and samples information",
            "The collection of archaeological human remains analyzed and reported in this study was unearthed from the medieval Capidava necropolis (sector X, extra muros, Information Center point, C58 archaeological complex) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1), located in the Dobruja region, Constan\u021ba County, Capidava village, during the preventive archaeological research performed in 2015 as part of the preservation and restoration project of the Capidava fortress. The archaeological survey was authorized by the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Identity through the National Commission of Archaeology (permit number 62/30.03.2015/M.C.). A detailed preliminary archaeological report is available in Romanian at http://cronica.cimec.ro/ (Cronica Cercet\u0103rilor Arheologice Din Rom\u00e2nia 2016, edited by the National Institute of Heritage). All human remains belonging to ten individuals discussed in this paper have been transferred to a permanent collection deposited for research at the Molecular Biology Center, Interdisciplinary Research Institute on Bio-Nano Sciences, \u201cBabe\u0219-Bolyai\u201d University in Cluj-Napoca and carry the following codes: Cap-C58-1, Cap-C58-2, Cap-C58-3, Cap-C58-5, Cap-C58-6, Cap-C58-7, Cap-C58-9, Cap-C58-10, Cap-C58-11. The collection is open to researchers, upon request.",
            "A total number of 186 funerary units were discovered during the above mentioned archaeological excavations (sector X, extra muros, Information Center, Access way and Parking lot points), most of them being simple, quadrilateral inhumation graves that contain a single individual. With the exception of two Bronze Age individuals, the rest of them were dated to the medieval period based on funerary rituals, grave goods or subsequent radiocarbon dating. Peculiar for this necropolis is the presence of a circular multiple burial pit containing the skeletal remains of ten individuals which are the subject of this study (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2). A direct radiocarbon dating was performed at Beta Analytic (Florida, USA), using the human osteological material retrieved from two graves, one containing a single individual showing signs of similar disregard towards the deceased (ventral decubitus), located in the proximity of the multiple burial (Cap-C143, Beta - 475779), and one from the multiple burial (Cap-C58-1, Beta \u2013 475778). Radiocarbon dating for a Capidava individual buried in a typical single grave (Cap-M4, B terrace) was previously published and mentioned in the Results section. Details regarding the archaeological background and associated images can be found in the Supplementary Information.",
            "Osteological analysis",
            "All bone fragments and dental samples recovered from the Capidava multiple burial were morphologically evaluated at the Interdisciplinary Research Institute on Bio-Nano Sciences, \u201cBabe\u0219-Bolyai\u201d University in Cluj-Napoca. The anthropological investigation was carried out at individual level in order to gather information on age at death, sex, traces of injuries, pathological conditions, and stress markers that can infer the demographic structure and epidemiological conditions of this group of medieval individuals. The osteological examination was performed using previously described standard guidelines and the results are summarized in the Supplementary Table\u00a0S1. The availability of dental specimens with good preservation status was an eliminatory sample selection criterion for ulterior molecular genetic investigations. Therefore, aDNA analysis was not attempted in case of four archaeological individuals (Cap C58-4, Cap C58-7, Cap-C58-10, and Cap-C58-11).",
            "DNA extraction and sequencing",
            "Six specimens consisting of intact multi-rooted teeth (labeled as Cap-C58-1, Cap-C58-2, Cap-C58-3, Cap-C58-5, Cap-C58-6, and Cap-C58-9) were sampled and stored for genetic analysis during the archaeological excavation. All procedures leading to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) were performed in dedicated aDNA facilities of the Molecular Anthropology Laboratory, University of Florence. Standard criteria for the analysis of aDNA were rigorously followed and strict precautionary measures were undertaken to avoid contamination with exogenous DNA. All experimental steps were implemented following the protocol described in detail by Modi et al. and Tassi et al.. In brief, each tooth sample was cleaned by mechanical abrasion of the surface using a dental micro-drill, followed by UV irradiation (254\u2009nm) for 45\u2009minutes, on each side. The powdered tissue used for the isolation of genetic material was obtained from the tooth roots using the same dental device at a very low rotation speed. For each sample, DNA was extracted from 50\u2009mg of biological material following a silica-based protocol, specially designed to target ultra-short molecules. Illumina libraries were constructed using a previously developed protocol. No enzymatic treatment for damage repair was applied in order to preserve and consequently analyze the degradation patterns of DNA fragments. The libraries were amplified to reach plateau and enriched for human mitochondrial DNA using a selective bead-capture approach by hybridization of aDNA with probes consisting of long-range PCR products. A negative control was processed during all analytical phases to monitor for possible contamination. The enriched libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios with libraries from other samples and paired-end sequenced (2\u2009\u00d7\u200975\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u20098 cycles) using the Illumina MiSeq platform.",
            "Bioinformatic NGS data processing and authentication",
            "To reconstruct the mitochondrial sequences we used schmutzi, an iterative approach that jointly estimates present-day human contamination and assembles the endogenous mitochondrial genome. Forward and reverse reads were merged into single sequences with a minimum overlap of 10\u2009bp between paired-end reads and the adapters were trimmed using SeqPrep. Unmerged sequences and sequences shorter than 30\u2009bp were discarded. BWA software package was used for mapping the filtered reads against the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS, NC_012920.1), applying recommended parameter settings for aDNA molecules \u201c\u2013l 1000 \u2013n 0.01 \u2013o 2\u201d. After removing PCR duplicates, only sequences with a map quality score \u226530 were retained and used to align at unique positions along the reference sequence. Consensus sequences for the mitochondrial genomes of all samples were called using schmutzi (parameters: \u201c\u2013logindel 1\u2013uselength\u201d). DNA damage patterns at the ends of the molecules and average fragment length were taken into account to identify and call endogenous bases. Present-day human contamination estimates were performed using a non-redundant database of 197 human mitochondrial genomes available in the software package. Misincorporation patterns at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were computed using contDeam, a program provided with schmutzi packages. A summary of NGS data for each analyzed sample can be found in the Supplementary Table\u00a0S2. Mitochondrial haplotypes for each sample were determined with the use of HaploGrep, based on PhyloTree build 17 (Supplementary Table\u00a0S3). Consensus sequences corresponding to each medieval individual from Capidava were submitted to NCBI GenBank under the accession numbers MH298069-MH298074.",
            "Phylogenetic and population genetics analysis",
            "The phylogenetic relationships of the six newly characterized mitogenomes and other modern and ancient published data were inferred from haplotype networks. For this purpose, we have searched in the available online databases and literature for sequences that correspond to the haplogroups identified in the Capidava multiple burial pit. All matching complete mtDNA sequences were downloaded from web depositories (NCBI Nucleotide, European Nucleotide Archive) or were requested from the authors (Supplementary Table\u00a0S4). The haplogroup of all sequences was re-checked using HaploFind and we grouped them according to their maternal lineage. All nucleotide sequence subsets were aligned with MAFFT version 7 applying the progressive method G-INS-1. Multiple sequence alignments were converted into Nexus format files with MEGA which were used to build median-joining networks in PopART with default settings. The phylogeographic relations were inferred based on the geographic origin of the most similar sequences from literature.",
            "Another database of full-length mitochondrial sequences comprising 282 ancient samples from 17 relevant Eurasian populations was assembled from published literature (Supplementary Table\u00a0S5) in order to evaluate the genetic similarities between them and the samples analyzed in this study. The samples were grouped according to their geographic and chronological affiliations. In cases where populations consisted of very low sample numbers, related neighboring groups were brought together, if possible. For this reason, the six Capidava samples analyzed in this study were clustered with previously described NGS medieval samples from the same archaeological site under the \u201cRou-med\u201d umbrella. Pairwise population differentiation values (FST) were calculated from complete mtDNA genomes using the Arlequin 3.5.2.2 software. Nucleotide positions showing point indels (309.1\u2009C(C), 315.1\u2009C, AC indels at 515\u2013522, A16182c, A16183c, and 16193.1\u2009C(C)) were excluded from the analysis as they can cause difficulties when multiple mtDNA genomes are aligned. The most appropriate nucleotide substitution model and the estimate of gamma parameter were determined with jModeltest 2.1.10.. The FST values of the ancient dataset were computed assuming a Tamura & Nei substitution model, 10000 permutations for p-value calculation and an allowed level of missing data of 0.05. The matrix of Slatkin FST values (Supplementary Table\u00a0S6) was displayed on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot represented in a two-dimensional space (Fig.\u00a08) using metaMDS function based on Euclidean distances implemented in the vegan library of R 3.3.2. The FST values were also represented by different color shadings to indicate the degree of similarity or dissimilarity of the ROU-med population to the ancient Eurasian populations and visualized on a geographic map (Fig.\u00a07).",

            "ABSTRACT",
            "Ibiza was permanently settled around the 7th century BCE by founders arriving from west Phoenicia. The founding population grew significantly and reached its height during the 4th century BCE. We obtained nine complete mitochondrial genomes from skeletal remains from two Punic necropoli in Ibiza and a Bronze Age site from Formentara. We also obtained low coverage (0.47X average depth) of the genome of one individual, directly dated to 361\u2013178\u2009cal BCE, from the Cas Mol\u00ed site on Ibiza. We analysed and compared ancient DNA results with 18 new mitochondrial genomes from modern Ibizans to determine the ancestry of the founders of Ibiza. The mitochondrial results indicate a predominantly recent European maternal ancestry for the current Ibizan population while the whole genome data suggest a significant Eastern Mediterranean component. Our mitochondrial results suggest a genetic discontinuity between the early Phoenician settlers and the island\u2019s modern inhabitants. Our data, while limited, suggest that the Eastern or North African influence in the Punic population of Ibiza was primarily male dominated.",
            "INTRO",
            "Introduction",
            "The Phoenician culture was one of the most prevailing and widespread in the history of the Mediterranean basin. From its rise in the northern Levant, the Phoenicians connected east and west for over a millennium through their established trade networks across the Mediterranean, reaching beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. One of their first western outposts was the city of Gadir, modern Cadiz, on the Atlantic coast of Spain believed to be initially settled around 1100 BCE, then became a fully-fledged Phoenician settlement by the end of the 9th century BCE. Additional Phoenician settlements were established on the Balearic islands, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, and Cyprus. These Islands form a strategic arc across the northern Mediterranean allowing for island hopping from the Levantine homeland to the Iberian Peninsula and North African coast where they established their most dominant Western Mediterranean settlement in Carthage. The early Phoenician settlements in the Western Mediterranean are generally referred to as Western Phoenicia. From the middle of the sixth century BCE onwards, with the shift in Phoenician influence from the Levant to Carthage, they are typically referred to as Punic, and from the 6th century BCE onward this term has become synonymous to Phoenicians outside the Levant. Our previous research has shown that the Phoenician settlers who encountered indigenous communities already living on the islands that they settled were integrated to form the new Phoenician societies.",
            "Archaeological evidence on the largest of the Balearic Islands, Mallorca and Menorca, indicates continuous settlement since the 3rd millennium BCE. Limited evidence favours some level of continuity of prehistoric settlement in Ibiza from the end of Bronze Age until the arrival of Phoenicians in the 7th century BCE. These Bronze Age settlements however, had relatively small populations compared to the larger Balearic Islands. Ancient DNA analyses of human remains from early Ibizan sites can therefore provide evidence as to the origins of the Phoenician settlers of the island and the relationship between these early settlers and the modern population of the island. Further, when combined with other genetic data from Phoenician populations, analyses can provide key information about the process of Phoenician expansion and settlement of the Western Mediterranean.",
            "The archaeological evidence to date suggests that the Phoenicians first settled on the island of Ibiza around 654 BCE, arriving from west Phoenicia. They initially established a small settlement at the Bay of Ibiza and a second on Sa Caleta which was later abandoned. The first settlement gave rise to the Phoenician city of Ibusim or Ebusus. The strategic importance of Ibiza did not escape the Phoenician navigators who realized that by controlling the Bay of Ibiza they could dominate maritime movement in all the North-western Mediterranean. Phoenician presence in these prime coastal locations asserted and ensured their maritime control over the entire Mediterranean and they controlled access to the Atlantic Ocean. For several centuries, the Phoenicians dominated metal trade from the Atlantic to the Eastern Mediterranean.",
            "The Phoenicians, and later the Punics, remained the main inhabitants of Ibiza for about seven centuries as demonstrated by the archaeological evidence from Puig des Molins, one of the largest necropoli in the Western Mediterranean, now a World Heritage site, with around 3000 tombs. Burial data from this necropolis suggest three phases of the early demographic history of Ibiza. The small founding population arrived from west Phoenicia, most probably Gadir, during the 7th century BCE, and they are identified by their funerary rituals, that primarily involved cremation. The second phase occurred between the 5th and 4th centuries BCE and is indicated by a significant and rapid expansion in population size, reaching nearly 4,000 inhabitants. This growth may have been driven by a population flow from Carthage and other Punic settlements in the Mediterranean and coincides with a period of prosperity and major development of the island. The third and last phase of this early settlement period was between the 3rd and 2nd centuries during which Ibiza witnessed a period of economic decline and the return of cremation funerary rituals. After the 2nd Punic War, Ibiza started a long process of integration in the Roman Empire, which culminated in 74 AD, when it became a Latin Municipium. The Roman impact on the local inhabitants of Ibiza appears to have been minimal as is indicated by limited evidence of influence in the archaeological record. The Ibizan population remained somewhat isolated while under Roman political influence until the Islamic conquest of the island by Arabs and Berbers around 902 CE and they remained under Muslim rule for 333 years. Beginning around 1229 CE the Balearic Islands, including Ibiza in 1235, were impacted by immigrants from Catalonia, in mainland Spain, and the population of Ibiza slowly grew in number, but relative isolation of the autochthonous population continued and is still maintained today. The extent of admixture between the indigenous Phoenician derived population of Ibiza and later occupiers has not been investigated at the genetic level, though genetic studies of the modern population of Ibiza indicate that they are distinct from the other Balearic Island and from mainland populations. Pacelli and M\u00e1rquez-Grant suggest that this difference may be due to the arrival of North African Punic settlers, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.",
            "Here we report ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses of archaeological remains from two Punic necropoli on Ibiza, obtained through high-throughput sequencing. We determine the maternal ancestry of the founders of Ibiza through analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of 8 archaeological samples from Ibiza. These ancient mitogenomes are compared to the first complete mitogenome data generated for 18 modern Ibizans to determine if there is genetic continuity between the original Phoenician settlers and the modern indigenous population of the island today and to elucidate the settlement history of Ibiza. The complete mitogenome from a Chalcolithic/Early Bronze-Age sample from the Island of Formentera was also obtained, providing evidence of the ancestry of the pre-Phoenician occupants of this island. Finally, we present the first genome-wide sequence data obtained from an ancient Phoenician and assess the likely ancestry of this individual from Ibiza. The accumulating aDNA evidence from Phoenicians from Ibiza, Sardinia, Tunisia and Lebanon is providing valuable information regarding the Phoenician expansion practices and the development of Phoenician communities in the Western Mediterranean.",

The archaeological context for these samples is provided in the Supplemental Data\u00a01. We were able to obtain data to reconstruct complete or near complete mitogenomes from nine of these samples and 0.47X average depth of coverage of the whole genome of the Cas Mol\u00ed sample (MS10614).",
            "A total of 18 modern DNA samples, obtained from volunteers from Ibiza, initially sampled by researchers from the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (IBE), Barcelona, as part of a study on Y chromosomes and surnames, were sent to the University of Otago for full mitogenome sequencing. Individuals were only included in the sampling if all four grandparents were born on Ibiza and carried Ibizan surnames.",
            "Processing and sequencing of samples",
            "All ancient DNA processing was conducted in a dedicated aDNA facility at the University of Otago. DNA was extracted from archaeological teeth using standard protocols. Double stranded Illumina libraries were constructed with dual barcodes for the ancient samples as described previously, and the mitochondrial DNA was captured using hybridization with modern human mitochondrial bait, generated in our lab.",
            "Modern DNA samples were sent by CSIC-UPF to the University of Otago where they were processed in a separate lab from the aDNA facility, and mitogenomes were amplified, prepared and sequenced as described previously.",
            "All ancient sequences obtained were assessed for potential contamination and DNA damage patterns. Deamination and fragment lengths were all as expected for ancient samples (Supplementary Data\u00a02). Consensus sequences were created (including indels) and deposited in GenBank. Sequences were assigned to haplogroups using Haplogrep with Phylotree build 17. All aDNA reads generated have been submitted to the NCBI sequence read archive identified by lab sample number. All mtDNA haplogroup determinations for samples processed in this study and associated archaeological site names, dates, GenBank accession numbers, coverage and contamination estimates are shown in Table\u00a01. Additional sample information is provided in Supplementary Table\u00a01. All ancient samples processed showed minimal estimates of contamination except for sample MS10589, from Formentara, which returned an estimate of 14%. We therefore filtered the data to only include damaged reads which resulted in reduced coverage but the same haplogroup call, so we included this pre-Phoenician sample in our analyses.",
            "Generation of nuclear data",
            "One ancient sample (MS10614) was selected for shotgun sequencing, based on the high genome coverage observed in the mitochondrial sequencing of this sample. Adequate preservation was confirmed with an estimated 9% endogenous DNA content. The sex of this sample was determined based on computing the number of alignments to the Y Chromosome (nY) as a fraction of the total alignments to both sex chromosomes (nX\u2009+\u2009nY). The ratio of Y:X\u2009+\u2009Y coverage was 0.0042 (SE 0.0001, 95% CI 0.0041\u20130.0044) and thus the individual was determined to be female, which is inconsistent with the sex determination based on skeletal characteristics. After mapping the shotgun reads to the UCSC reference genome hg19, the resulting bam file was aligned with the Human Origins SNP dataset to call a pseudo-haploid genotype. This genotype was merged with previously published ancient and modern SNP data sets, resulting in a total of 119,316 SNPs used in subsequent analyses (See Supplementary Table\u00a02).",
            "Radiocarbon Dating of sample MS10614",
            "A subsample of the tooth from which the DNA was extracted was sent to Beta Analytic Inc. (Miami) for AMS dating. It returned a conventional radiocarbon age of 2190 \u00b1 30, which provided a calibrated date range of 361\u2013178\u2009cal BC (2310\u20132127\u2009cal BP), at 95.4% probability. This date is consistent with the archaeological context proposed by the archaeologists who excavated the site, suggesting 3rd century BCE.",

            "Nine complete mitogenomes were successfully obtained from 13 ancient samples and their Hg were determined. In addition, mitogenomes and their Hg were successfully determined from 18 modern Ibizans (Table\u00a01). A Median Joining network of 111 mitogenomes representing the ancient and modern mitogenomes generated in this study with 83 publicly available ancient mitogenomes from European and Near Eastern and modern North African populations is shown in Fig.\u00a01.",
            "To investigate the similarities between our Ibizans and other ancient samples from the Iberian mainland and the other Balearic islands we reduced our data to the comparable, publicly available HVR regions of 383\u2009bp for Neolithic and Bronze age Iberian samples and 156\u2009bp of data from Neolithic and Iron Age samples from Mallorca and Menorca and constructed Median Joining (MJ) networks shown in Fig.\u00a02.",
            "To test for continuity between ancient and modern Ibizan haplotypes, we performed a temporal network analysis, shown in Fig.\u00a03, which indicates that there were no shared haplotypes between the ancient and modern Ibizans.",
            "Following the lack of DNA evidence for continuity between the Phoenician and modern Ibizan populations, we compared the modern and Phoenician mitochondrial data to other likely candidate source populations. Genetic distance (FST) was calculated between modern Ibizans and multiple candidate source populations. Pairwise FST between all populations were visualized in a MDS plot (Supplementary Data\u00a03), to assess the genetic distance between Ibiza and candidate source populations in comparison to the genetic distance among source populations. The genetic distance between modern Ibizans and candidate source populations was then visualized on a map, to refine our estimates of populations maternally closely related to the modern Ibizans (Fig.\u00a04).",
            "To determine if there were any patterns observed between Phoenician populations in the Mediterranean, we combined our ancient Phoenician data with previously published mitogenome data for a range of Mediterranean populations including pre-Phoenician, Phoenician and modern Sardinians and pre-Phoenician, Phoenician and Modern Lebanese as well as modern mainland Spanish and performed multidimensional scaling of pairwise genetic distance (Fig.\u00a05).",
            "Analysis of whole genome shotgun data",
            "The origins of the Phoenician Ibizan individual (MS10614) were first assessed by constructing a PCA with the 1000 genome data from three worldwide populations, Asia (CHB), Europe (CEU) and Africa (YRI) in which MS10614 was located closest to the European samples (when including both tranversions only and transitions and transversions) (Supplemental Fig.\u00a04a). To provide more context within the European cluster we first added to our initial PCA analyses data from modern Iberians (IBS) and Levantine populations from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. The Ibizan sample plotted within the Levantine cluster, outside of the modern Iberians (Supplemental Fig.\u00a04b). When considering more fine-grained analysis including only the Levantine and Iberian modern data with MS10614, the Ibizan positioned between the Iberian and Levantine samples, with more affinity to the Levantine populations (Fig.\u00a06a). We conducted a further test, adding North African populations to the analyses (Fig.\u00a06b) and see that MS10614 is situated more closely to the Levantine and Iberian samples and not the North Africans. Finally, since modern populations are likely to have changed significantly in the 2000\u2009+\u2009years since the Phoenician expansion, we undertook similar analyses to assess the relationship between MS10614 and other ancient populations (Fig.\u00a06c). The ancient sample MS10614 was also plotted with the modern Human Origins (HO) dataset for reference (Supplemental Fig.\u00a04c).",
            "The ancestry of MS10614 was also estimated using model-based clustering in ADMIXTURE (Supplementary Data\u00a05). The most appropriate model was k\u2009=\u20092, determined by selecting the value of k with the lowest cross-validation error, though k\u2009=\u20093 had only a slightly higher cross-validation score, and both are shown in Fig.\u00a07, which shows a subset of the data, consisting of the Iberian and Levantine populations. The model k\u2009=\u20093 shows a new component (dark blue) that impacts all of the Eastern Mediterranean populations and the modern Iberians. Sample MS10614 has an intermediate amount of this component, with more than modern Spanish, but less than modern Lebanese and ancient Levantines.",
            "Outgroup f3-statistics were used to measure shared genetic drift between MS10614 and other ancient and modern populations. These results indicated that this Phoenician individual is most closely related to Neolithic aged samples from Iberia and Anatolia, plotting away from North African samples, providing further evidence for this individual having ancestry from both mainland Europe and the Near East (Supplementary Data\u00a06). D-statistics were similarly supportive of gene flow between the Phoenician MS10614 and both Neolithic aged Iberian and Anatolian samples, however there was no statistical significance between the inferred gene flow from each of these regions with the Phoenician Ibiza individual.",
            "DISCUSS",
            "Discussion",
            "Most Phoenician trading ports were initially founded in locations where there was already an established indigenous community, resulting in integration of locals into the growing Phoenician settlement. The settlement history of Ibiza offers a valuable opportunity to investigate the genetic makeup of a Phoenician population where there was a relatively very small indigenous population at the time of Phoenician arrival. Being a likely secondary Phoenician settlement from the city of Gadir, the early population of Ibiza also potentially provides information about Phoenician settlements on the Iberian mainland. The data presented here adds to our previous research investigating admixture in Phoenician settlements across the Western Mediterranean. It also helps dissect and possibly identify the origins of the various populations that ultimately contributed to the genetic makeup of the modern Ibizans.",
            "Our analyses of the mitogenomes of the ancient samples from Ibiza indicate a predominantly European maternal ancestry for the population (Fig.\u00a01). Haplogroups H1 and H3, which either emerged from the Franco-Iberian refugia of the LGM, or arrived with early Neolithic expansions, account for 50% of the Ibizan ancient samples (see Table\u00a01). Szecseny-Nagy et al. also found similarly high rates of haplogroup H in their analyses of the Hyper-Variable Region (HVR) of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Iberian samples. Investigating coding region SNPs, they showed that among haplogroup H, 65% belonged to hg H1 and 14% to hg H3. Particularly high frequencies of H1 and H3 are also seen in ancient and modern Sardinians. The majority of the remaining haplogroups present in the Phoenician population of Ibiza, U4a, U5b, and T2b have all been identified in Mesolithic or Neolithic populations in Western Europe including Iberia. Haplogroup U5b3 frequencies, though generally low across Europe, are the highest today in Sardinia and Spanish Andalusia and are thus also consistent with an Iberian origin or possible contacts with Phoenician Sardinia. Haplogroup J1c is thought to have an eastern Mediterranean origin and has been identified in several Neolithic samples in Eastern Europe and in a Chalcolithic sample (2880\u20132630 BCE) from the El Mirador Cave site, Atapuerca, Spain. Haplogroup J1c has not been found previously in any ancient samples in the Levant and appears to have been distributed across Europe with the Neolithic expansion, suggesting that it may have been picked up in Northern Anatolia. Olivieri et al. found a J1c3 haplotype in one of their ancient samples from Sardinia (MA74), dated to 6190\u20136000 calBP and thus its presence in our Puig des Molins samples is not unexpected, as this lineage was clearly present in the Western Mediterranean region at the time that Ibiza was settled. The primary Phoenician settlers of Ibiza are likely to have be males who sailed from Gadir and the presence of these haplogroups provides additional support to our previous work suggesting that local female integration was a hallmark of Phoenician settlement history across the Mediterranean basin.",
            "Our previous analyses of Phoenician mtDNA from Monte Sirai, Sardinia, another Western Mediterranean Phoenician and Punic settlement, indicated significant integration of indigenous women among the predominantly male Phoenician settlers. We suggest a similar pattern is indicated for the Phoenician settlement of Ibiza. When we investigated the relationships of mitogenomes of Phoenician populations from Lebanon, Sardinia and Ibiza (Fig.\u00a05) we found that there was no particular affinity amongst Phoenician populations (circles) when compared to pre-Phoenician or modern populations from those locations. This may indicate that local female integration was indeed a common strategy of Phoenician settlements. We expect that the integration of indigenous women from south central coastal Iberia into the Phoenician settlement of Gadir must have also occurred and that the ancient mitochondrial lineages observed Ibiza were brought along from Gadir or, alternatively, from some other Phoenician settlement in the Central or Western Mediterranean. Analyses of ancient Phoenician samples from Gadir and complete mitogenomic sequencing of ancient samples from across the Iberian Peninsula are needed to fully test this explanation. Analyses of HVR sequences from Neolithic and Early Bronze Age samples from the Iberian peninsula and modern southern Iberian populations indicate that there may be differences between the southwest and southeast Iberian populations, and it may be possible to locate particular regions of the Iberian coast from which these mtDNA lineages originated.",
            "There was a sizable increase in the number of the Punic burials at Puig des Molins during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, indicating a surge in the population size of Ibiza. This increase is largely attributed by historians to the movement of people from other prospering Phoenician/Punic settlements in nearby Sardinia and Carthage. Despite anthropological evidence supporting the presence of North and sub-Saharan African ancestry in Punic individuals from the Island of Ibiza, mitochondrial lineages exclusively associated with North Africa or the Near East were not observed in our ancient Ibizan samples, although several of these lineages were previously identified in Phoenician samples from Sardinia, i.e. haplogroup N1b1a5. Our results cannot, however, rule out the arrival of admixed individuals with European maternal ancestry from Phoenician sites in Sardinia, North Africa or the Iberian mainland. In fact, we previously identified a likely Iberian mtDNA haplotype, U5b2c1, in a young Carthaginian, suggesting the presence of an admixed population there by late 6th century BCE. We also note that haplogroups H1 and H3, while European in origin, are also found at high frequency in North African populations, particularly H1, which is today found at levels of 40\u201345% in northwest Africa. Haplogroup H1bc was identified in a Bronze Age sample from Sidon and H1 is present in modern Lebanese. It is therefore possible, that these H lineages could have been brought to Ibiza, with Phoenicians from either the Levantine homeland or North Africa. It is a more parsimonious suggestion, however, that their presence in Ibiza is due to a more direct European and probably and Iberian source, particularly given the lack of any mitogenomes of clear North African or Near Eastern origin identified in the ancient Ibizan population sampled thus far. The morphological characteristics indicating African ancestry in crania from Punic contexts in Ibiza identified by M\u00e1rquez-Grant could be consistent with our aDNA results if the African admixture in Ibiza was male dominated. Alternatively, aDNA analyses of additional Phoenician samples from Ibiza may indeed find non-European mtDNA lineages, but to date, we have only observed what appears to be a typical European, and primarily Western European signature.",
            "Unfortunately, to really dissect population mtDNA histories generally, and those of southwest Europe or any region with high rates of haplogroup H in particular, complete mitogenome sequencing is necessary. Despite the large sample sizes for studies of HVR sequences for the Iberian Peninsula, there are few complete ancient mitogenome sequences publicly available particularly beyond the Basque region. As Hernandez et al. point out, secure assignment to haplogroup H is not possible based on control region sequencing alone, as it requires identification of T7028C. Further sub-typing of haplogroup H also requires the identification of key coding region SNPs (for example, G3010A for H1, T6776C for H3).",
            "In addition to the ancient Ibiza samples, we sequenced a complete mitogenome of a Late Chalcolithic/Early-Bronze Age sample (MS10589) from the Ca na Costa site on the island of Formentera which was determined to belong to the K1a1b haplogroup. Mathieson et al. identified K1a1b1 in a Middle Neolithic Iberian sample (Mina3) with an archaeological context dated to 3900\u20133600 BCE. In their analyses of mtDNA hypervariable region sequences obtained from ancient samples from Neolithic and Iron-Age necropoli from Mallorca and Menorca, Sim\u00f3n et al. found that 4.34% belonged to Haplogroup K, with the highest frequency (10%) in the oldest (Neolithic) necropolis, Cova des Pas, on Minorca. Our K1a1b result may indicate that the initial settlement of Formentera, prior to the arrival of the Phoenicians, also likely came from the mainland or via Mallorca, an observation presented by Bellard. Olivieri et al. found K1a and K1b1b1 in pre-Phoenician Sardinians, but we have yet to find haplogroup K in any of our Phoenician samples.",
            "Ibiza has had a complex history of resettlement periods since the time of the Phoenicians. In addition to a Phoenician founding population, modern Ibizans would have had potential genetic influences from later Punic settlements, like Carthage and our ancient DNA data are consistent with this scenario. Historic records would suggest that the Ibizan genetic signature was also likely influenced by the arrival of Arab and Berber populations during the first millennium CE and finally, from 1200 CE, it was said to be overwhelmed by mainland colonists. This might explain the discontinuity between the ancient and modern DNA results we observed, shown in Fig.\u00a03 and is consistent with the results of Ramon and colleagues, based on HLA markers and blood groups in Ibizans, and earlier mtDNA and Y-chromosome studies which show affinities to North African and Near Eastern populations.",
            "Our TempNet results showed little continuity between the Phoenician inhabitants of the island and the modern Ibizan population. No shared haplotypes were found and only one haplogroup, T2b, was found in both groups. Perhaps most surprising was that neither haplogroups H1 or H3 were found in the modern Ibizans. These two haplogroups were not only the most common in our ancient population but are found at high frequencies in both modern North African and Western European populations generally. The modern Ibizan population is singularly unusual in the entire Western Mediterranean region for their apparent lack of these two common haplogroups. It is possible that the mtDNA frequencies are so different from the ancient samples due to random genetic drift, which is common in small island populations. The small sample size (n\u2009=\u200918) could also be a factor, though our result indicating that the modern Ibizans are genetically quite different to mainland populations is consistent with previous studies.",
            "Haplogroups T1 and V, found in the modern Ibizans, are lineages found at reasonably high frequencies in the Near East. Haplogroup V is also found in\u00a0both ancient and modern populations from the Iberian Peninsula and in ancient samples from Mallorca and Minorca, and T1 is also found at low frequency in mainland Spain today. These lineages are also found in Berbers which could explain their presence in the modern Ibizans. Haplogroup L2c however, which was identified in two unrelated, modern Ibizans, has not been found in Berbers. It is typically a West African, sub-Saharan lineage and it may have been introduced during the Islamic expansion which had significant exchange with the entire African continent. Alternatively, it could have been a more recent arrival, perhaps the result of the transatlantic slave trade. Botigu\u00e9 et al., showed in their whole genome analyses that sub-Saharan ancestry was less than 1% in Europe, except for the Canary Islands, where Maca-Meyer et al. found L2c in both 17th and 18th century historic and modern individuals. Another sub-Saharan lineage, L1b has also been identified in a Late Chalcolithic population in central Iberia and in one 7th century CE sample from Mallorca.",
            "The remaining lineages identified in modern Ibizans are all either exclusively European markers (e.g. J2b1a) or are widely distributed across Europe and the Near East and identifying the specific origin of the population influx that causes the discontinuity between ancient and modern Ibizans is difficult. The FST results for the complete mitogenomes shown in Fig.\u00a04 do not indicate a single likely source, though the closest population to modern Ibizans appears to be France. France may be acting as a proxy for a more likely source of settlers to Ibiza, namely Catalonia, since it has been shown to be genetically closely related. Further whole genome analyses of the modern indigenous Ibizans would provide the necessary data to fully assess the origins of this population, but from a mitochondrial perspective, it appears that they are not directly related to the Phoenician and Punic founding populations and thus this is not the explanation for the unusual genetic signature.",
            "While the mitochondrial evidence suggests that the founding female population of Ibiza was primarily derived from a mainland Iberian source, the results of the whole genome analyses of sample MS10614 indicate a significant Eastern Mediterranean/Levantine component. Sample MS10614 comes from an individual that was part of a collective burial inside a Punic hypogeum at Can Portes des Jurat, Cas Mol\u00ed. The sample was directly radiocarbon dated to 361\u2013178\u2009cal BCE. The archaeological context of the burial also suggests a 3rd century BCE date and thus this individual lived during the period of greater Punic influence of Ibiza or just after this period of population growth.",
            "As can be seen in Fig.\u00a06a,b, the Ibizan Phoenician sample, MS10614, plots in between modern Levantine and Iberian populations but closer to both of these than to modern North African populations. In Fig.\u00a06c, it is positioned most closely to a Levantine Neolithic sample, but in between a Sidon Bronze Age and European/Iberian Bronze Age samples. The ADMIXTURE result (k\u2009=\u20092) in Fig.\u00a07 also indicates that the genetic ancestry of this individual was intermediate between an Iberian Bronze Age and Levantine Bronze Age individuals. The result of k\u2009=\u20093, however, shows a third component (dark blue) found in Anatolian and Levantine Neolithic and Bronze Age individuals. This component is present in the ancient Ibizan and also present in modern Spanish. We suggest that this third component represents the Western Iranian Neolithic farmers that had admixed with the Levantine and Anatolian Neolithic populations. Levantine Bronze Age populations were further admixed with this component from both Anatolian Chalcolithic and Levantine Neolithic ancestry. This component is not present in ancient Iberians, supporting the notion that the main ancestral population of early European farmers were the Neolithic North-Western Anatolians before they were admixed with the Iranians. The presence of this component in modern Iberians is likely the result of historic influences.",
            "The mtDNA haplogroup of this individual, T2b, indicates that the direct maternal ancestry is likely local and the Levantine contribution may therefore represent paternal ancestry. This finding is in line with previous work by our group using Y-chromosome data showing East Mediterranean Y signatures across the Phoenician settlements in the West, including Ibiza. These signatures, attributed to the Phoenicians, were found to be present at the frequency of 6% among the modern male populations studied, indicating a substantial Phoenician male presence in settlements across the Western Mediterranean. The Near Eastern component to the genome of this individual may represent that of the founding Phoenician population, though the possibility that this individual or a recent ancestor may have arrived directly from the Levantine homeland or from Punic settlements in North Africa or elsewhere in the Phoenician interaction network cannot be ruled out, though the sample does not appear to be closely related to modern North African populations as shown in Fig.\u00a06b.",
            "In conclusion, our results show a complex pattern of settlement of the island of Ibiza. We demonstrate a clear genetic discontinuity between the early Phoenician settlers and the modern inhabitants of the island based on the mtDNA results. Thus, the unusual genetic signature of modern Ibizans is not likely to be the result of their Phoenician ancestry, at least from a mitochondrial perspective. It appears that multiple population arrivals through invasions or other movements combined with periods of population instability since the early Phoenician settlement may have led to a total reshuffling of the genetic makeup of this island. Over the last several centuries Ibiza witnessed population growth supported by the arrival of mainland populations to the island, followed by significant population reduction resulting from the bubonic plague and malaria. These events, combined with a founder effect, and inbreeding common in islands with a relatively small population such as Ibiza, could have resulted in the loss of the indigenous mtDNA signatures observed in the ancient samples we analysed. It appears that the lineages present in the Phoenicians of Ibiza were replaced by different European mtDNA haplogroups (which appear to be most closely related to those of modern French but likely also similar to Catalonians). Despite this lack of continuity observed in the mitochondrial genomes, previous Y chromosome analyses suggest that there is still some Phoenician signature in the modern Ibizan population. This is consistent with historical evidence suggesting that Phoenician influence in the West was male dominated and indicates that there was not a total replacement of the Ibizan founding population. Comparisons of the ancient Phoenician whole genome data with whole genome data from modern Ibizans will help clarify this point further. Finally, the whole genome data obtained from the ancient Ibizan sample belonged to an individual with a significant Eastern Mediterranean component, suggesting an admixed Phoenician community in Ibiza during the 3rd century BCE. While this result is consistent with the archaeological evidence and further indicates that diversity was a hallmark of Phoenician societies, it also highlights the complexity of island population settlements and underscores the importance of the inclusion of ancient DNA analysis in population genetics.",

This approach allowed us to see if the same pattern was reproduced or not and, since in both cases the behaviour observed resulted to be the same, we decided to stand with the more inclusive file (57,221 variants).",
            "In all the considered scenarios involving modern populations and MS10614, the Principal Component Analyses were produced calculating the eigenvectors with smartpca; the ancient sample was projected setting the lsqproject parameter to yes in the smartpca parameter file. In every case we only took into account those SNPs that were common to the merged datasets and the ancient sample. No minor allele frequency filter, or LD pruning were performed. In modern samples, only variants and samples with many missing calls were filtered out (>5% and >10%, respectively). Also, variants failing a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium exact test were discarded (p\u2009<\u200910\u22125).",
            "For the ancient samples, PCA was performed using the merged dataset containing the Phoenician Ibizan (MS10614), ancient individuals from Lazaridis et al., and Bronze Age samples from Sidon, using the \u2018smartpca\u2019 software from the Eigensoft package.",
            "Admixture: The ADMIXTURE v 1.3 software was used on a subset of the above merged dataset, comprised of the Phoenician Ibizan, Neolithic Anatolians, Late Neolithic-Bronze Age Europeans, Bronze Age Iberians, Bronze Age Levantines, Neolithic Levantines, modern Lebanese, modern Spanish, Bronze Age Sidon samples, and modern Tunisian populations. The ancestry proportions of these populations were assessed by testing clusters of K\u2009=\u20091\u201310 (shown in Supplemental Data\u00a05).",
            "F3 and D statistics: Outgroup f3 statistics were computed using the \u2018qp3pop\u2019 tool from the Admixtools package in the form of f3(Mbuti; X; MS10614) where \u2018X\u2019 tests all populations in the merged dataset. Based on the results of the outgroup f3 statistics, the \u2018qpDstat\u2019 tool from the Admixtools package in the form of D(MS10614; X; Y; Mbuti), where \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 tests populations identified as being ancestral to MS10614 in the f3 and PCA analyses (Supplemental Data\u00a06 and Table\u00a05).",
