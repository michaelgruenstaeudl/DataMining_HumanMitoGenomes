            "The recently enriched genomic history of Indigenous groups in the Americas is still meager concerning continental Central America. Here, we report ten pre-Hispanic (plus two early colonial) genomes and 84 genome-wide profiles from seven groups presently living in Panama. Our analyses reveal that pre-Hispanic demographic events contributed to the extensive genetic structure currently seen in the area, which is also characterized by a distinctive Isthmo-Colombian Indigenous component. This component drives these populations on a specific variability axis and derives from the local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin(s). Two of these ancestries were differentially associated to Pleistocene Indigenous groups that also moved into South America, leaving heterogenous genetic footprints. An additional Pleistocene ancestry was brought by a still unsampled population of the Isthmus (UPopI) that remained restricted to the Isthmian area, expanded locally during the early Holocene, and left genomic traces up to the present day.",

            "Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the peopling of sub-Arctic America started from Beringia before, during, and immediately after late Glacial times (Achilli et\u00a0al., 2018;Ardelean et\u00a0al., 2020;Becerra-Valdivia and Higham, 2020;Braje et\u00a0al., 2017;Skoglund and Reich, 2016;Waters, 2019;Yu et\u00a0al., 2020). Initial settlement attempts were followed by a more widespread peopling that reached southern South America as early as \u223c15 thousand years ago (kya) (Dillehay et\u00a0al., 2017). Recent studies of ancient and modern genomes describe a complex scenario prior to European contact with multiple migrations from Beringia, as initially suggested by mitochondrial DNA\u00a0(mtDNA) data (Achilli et\u00a0al., 2013;Brandini et\u00a0al., 2018;G\u00f3mez-Carballa et\u00a0al., 2018;Llamas et\u00a0al., 2016;Perego et\u00a0al., 2009;Perego et\u00a0al., 2010;Tamm et\u00a0al., 2007) as well as demographic spreads and admixture events along the two continents (Flegontov et\u00a0al., 2019;Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018;Posth et\u00a0al., 2018;Scheib et\u00a0al., 2018;Schroeder et\u00a0al., 2018). The great majority of ancestries in early Native Americans (NAs, here used to indicate Indigenous groups) derive from an ancestral Beringian population(s) that differentiated sometime between \u223c22 and \u223c18 kya and likely exhibited genetic sub-structure that may explain the initial late Glacial migration(s) as well as the spread of the so-called UPopA (unknown population in the Americas) whose legacy reappears in Central America \u223c8.7 kya, leaving signs in the gene pool of the Mixe (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018). In unglaciated eastern Beringia/northern North America, the first peoples split into two branches called Northern NA (NNA, or ANC-B) and Southern NA (SNA, or ANC-A). The most ancient representatives of SNA are individuals who were living on both sides of the Rocky Mountains more than 10 kya: the Clovis-associated Anzick-1 and the Spirit Cave individuals associated with Western Stemmed technology. Ancient individuals carrying SNA ancestries crossed the Panama land bridge and entered South America. Their fast spread along the southern continent is evidenced by the earliest archaeological human presence in the Southern Cone at 14.6 kya and by ancient human genomes dating more than 9 kya on both sides of the continent: at Cuncaicha (Peru) and Los Rieles (Chile) on the Pacific and Lapa do Santo and Lagoa Santa (Brazil) on the Atlantic. Another UPop (UPopY) with Australasian ancestry may have contributed to the early peopling of South America as recognized in one sample from the Lagoa Santa site and in some Amazonian groups that experienced isolation events (e.g., Surui and Karitiana) (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018;Skoglund et\u00a0al., 2015).",
            "However, the demographic dynamics underlying many of these events, before and after European contact, are still uncharacterized, especially at the regional level (Fernandes et\u00a0al., 2020;Lindo et\u00a0al., 2017;Nakatsuka et\u00a0al., 2020;N\u00e4gele et\u00a0al., 2020). The Panamanian isthmus lies between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and connects the two American continents. It was the only land bridge during the initial peopling of South America and has remained a crossroads of goods, technologies, ideas, and peoples throughout history, including more recent colonial times (Cooke, 2005;Cooke et\u00a0al., 2019;Hern\u00e1ndez Mora et\u00a0al., 2021). In light of Panama\u2019s geographic location, the archaeogenomic study of its past can reveal its demographic history, including movements between North and South America.",
            "This study involves international collaborative efforts that bring together archaeologists, geneticists, historians, anthropologists, and computer engineers to incorporate existing knowledge with genomic information about pre-Hispanic as well as modern Indigenous individuals from the Isthmus of Panama. It was possible with the support of local authorities and Indigenous peoples of Panama and centrally involved local co-authors of the present paper (J.R., T.M., M.T., J.M.P., R.C., J.M., and J.G.M.) with years of experience in the Isthmo-Colombian region. Samples from the ancient individuals were collected for the ArtEmpire European Research Council (ERC) project (Consolidator Grant CoG-2014 no. 648535) in collaboration with the Patronato Panam\u00e1 Viejo (PaPV) as established by the Convenio Espec\u00edfico de colaboraci\u00f3n entre el Patronato Panam\u00e1 Viejo de la Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 y la Universidad Pablo de Olavide, de Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, signed on January 20th, 2016.

Even though no ties to the pre-Hispanic inhabitants have been stated, we are engaging local Indigenous communities to present the information from this study and to seek their views. In general, the project has been designed to maximize opportunities for public engagement, as testified by ongoing meetings with local interest groups to discuss research design and findingst. In order to increase positive social impact, some information on the ancient samples are publicly available in the ArtEmpire\u2019s database, translated into Spanish to increase accessibility (https://artempire.cica.es/) (Aram et\u00a0al., 2020), and a documentary also has been released (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BmxppS4oks).",
            "The collection of the modern Indigenous samples was approved by the Comit\u00e9 de Bio\u00e9tica de la investigaci\u00f3n del Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas and undertaken by the Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud (ICGES, Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies) of Panama.

            "Paleoecological and archaeological data point to a continuous human inhabitation of the Isthmo-Colombian area from approximately 16 kya (Cooke et\u00a0al., 2013;Ranere and Cooke, 2020). Clear evidence for the cultivation of domesticated plants, including maize (Zea mays), manioc (Manihot esculenta), and squash (Cucurbita moschata), dates back to more than 8\u20134.5 kya (Linares, 1977a,1977b;Linares and Ranere, 1980;Linares et\u00a0al., 1975;Piperno, 2011;Ranere and Cooke, 2020), while Panama\u2019s first pottery (Monagrillo ware) appeared about 4.5 kya (Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2015,2016). By 3 kya, the area\u2019s western region possesses all the characteristics of a coherent historical unit (Greater Chiriqu\u00ed, which extended into present-day Costa Rica), while this consensus is not available for the central and eastern regions, often termed Greater Cocl\u00e9 and Greater Dari\u00e9n (see specific section inSTAR Methodsfor further details).",
            "From approximately 500 BCE to 1,500 CE, relations among neighbors oscillated between cooperation driven by exchange and trade and conflict over land and resources. Although polities often called chiefdoms expanded and contracted, there is no evidence for aggressive empire building as in Mexico or the Andes (Helms, 2014). On the eve of the Spanish invasion, historians and most archaeologists agree that much of the central and eastern Isthmus was inhabited by Indigenous polities that spoke languages in the Nuclear Chibchan family (with variants of languages in the Chocoan family probably also spoken on the Pacific side) and used the \u201clanguage of Cueva\u201d as alingua franca(either a trade language or a group of vernaculars) in a linguistically complex region, much as the Hu\u00ebtar did in Costa Rica (Cooke 2016;Costenla, 2012;Romoli, 1987). Based on partial and fragmentary data, historians have ventured estimates of the pre-Hispanic population in those areas where the language of Cueva was spoken at European contact from 130,000 to 240,000 people and archaeologists have identified specific villages capable of sustaining up to 2,400 inhabitants (Cooke, 2005;Cooke et\u00a0al., 2019;Romoli, 1987). After nearly one millennium of less destructive war and trade among neighbors, European incursions provoked a rapid decline in the region\u2019s Indigenous populations. However, not all Indigenous groups experienced simultaneous demographic decline. Historical records suggest that an expansion among the Guna followed the reduction of other Indigenous groups (Castillero Calvo, 2017).",
            "To date uniparental systems have been examined to assess the genetic history of Panama: mtDNA data identified specific lineages predating the Clovis technological horizon (13.2 kya), while the comparison with Y chromosome data revealed a sex bias during the colonial period consistent with \u201cmore native men perishing or being deprived of reproductive rights than women\u201d (Grugni et\u00a0al., 2015;Perego et\u00a0al., 2012). Similar to mtDNA data, patterns of regional genetic continuity in some Indigenous American (IA) communities have been inferred from the analysis of nuclear genomes from continental Central America (Reich et\u00a0al., 2012), but without ancient DNA (aDNA) data from the Isthmian land bridge.",
            "To refine the human genetic history of the Isthmus, for the first time we have directly tested and analyzed autosomal markers of both pre-Hispanic human remains and contemporary Indigenous groups from Panama. Twenty ancient individuals (13 of them pre-Hispanic and seven colonial) were sampled from seven different archaeological excavations along the Pacific coast of Panama City, located from the residential area of Coco del Mar to the remnants of Old Panama\u2019s Cathedral in Panam\u00e1 Viejo, an area of pre-Hispanic inhabitation and the site of the colonial city from 1,519 to 1,671 CE (Hern\u00e1ndez Mora et\u00a0al., 2021). Modern sampling for a total of 84 individuals, 76 self-identified as associated with five different Indigenous groups plus four self-designated \u201cMoreno\u201d and four self-identified \u201cMestizo\u201d individuals (Figure\u00a01A;Table S1), took place in Panama City as well as in the provinces and Indigenous territories.",

            "Although the tropical environment and the proximity of the excavation sites to the ocean, with recurrent flooding, challenge the possibility of DNA preservation, we were able to obtain some of the first reliable aDNA data from the Isthmus. Starting from the initial collection of samples from 20 ancient individuals, we eventually assembled ancient low-coverage (\u22650.01X) genomes from 12 unrelated individuals (one female and eleven males), including ten from pre-Hispanic times (radiocarbon dated from 603 to 1,430 CE). Molecular decay analyses demonstrated the poor preservation of endogenous DNA, but error rate and validation tests confirmed the reliability of the retrieved genomic data (Table S2). In order to characterize the genetics of Isthmian individuals with the greatest possible spatial range and temporal depth, the 12 ancient genomes were compared with genome-wide data from 74 unrelated modern Panamanians and to available modern and ancient data by assembling different datasets (STAR Methods;Table S3).",
            "The evaluation of uniparental markers revealed the presence of the \u201cpan-American\u201d mtDNA haplogroups A2 and B2 in the pre-Hispanic samples, while two haplogroups, H1j1a and L2a1c2a, typical of Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans, respectively, were identified in the samples taken from colonial ancient individuals (Figure\u00a0S1A;Table S1).",

            "The most represented mtDNA haplogroup of pre-Hispanic Panamanians, A2af1, was previously identified (as A2af) at high frequencies among present-day Panamanians, mainly in the Comarca of Guna Yala (Perego et\u00a0al., 2012). It is characterized by the so-called \u201cHu\u00ebtar deletion,\u201d a peculiar 6-bp control-region deletion initially detected in the Chibchan-speaking Hu\u00ebtar from Costa Rica (Santos et\u00a0al., 1994).",
            "The eight pre-contact Y chromosomes are positive for the L54 marker, which characterizes all the Indigenous American branches of haplogroup Q (Figure\u00a0S1B). Two individuals (PAPV118, PAPV175) were further sub-classified as Q1b1a1a-M3 and one (PAPV117) as Q1b1a1a1-M848, the most frequent haplogroups among Indigenous peoples of the Americas (Grugni et\u00a0al., 2019;Pinotti et\u00a0al., 2019).",
            "An initial evaluation of the ancient low-coverage genomes made it possible to address long-standing anthropological and archaeological questions regarding the possible genetic relationships among individuals buried together. These cases included the ten human remains (one adult, nearly complete, female skeleton with nine adult male skulls beneath and around her) recovered from a pre-Hispanic burial denominated Tumba 1 underneath the Plaza Mayor of Panam\u00e1 Viejo, and a similar burial at Coco del Mar (approximately 1\u00a0km to the west of Panam\u00e1 Viejo), where a female skeleton was found accompanied by three male crania (Figure\u00a01B). Crania interred with prestigious individuals have been interpreted as evidence either of ancestor veneration or\u00a0of\u00a0human sacrifice with the ostentation of trophy heads (Mendizabal, 2004;Smith-Guzm\u00e1n and Cooke, 2018). Arguments in either case draw on presumed (recent or ancestral) tribal and biological relationships. Using genome-wide data, we can now exclude any genetic relatedness among the individuals. Moreover, the two females exhibit different mtDNA haplogroups (D1 and B2, respectively) with respect to the surrounding male crania (A2af1a1, B2b, and B2d in Tumba 1; A2af1b, A2w, and B2d in Coco del Mar).",
            "In combination with these genetic results, radiocarbon dates obtained for the pre-Hispanic individuals sampled from Panam\u00e1 Viejo and Coco del Mar point toward a more complex and nuanced interpretation. The two female figures, PAPV109 (1265-1375 CE) and PAPV172 (1051-1221 CE), were interred with crania dated from 603 to 1,390 CE (2 sigma) in the first case and from 657 to 1,430 CE (2 sigma) in the second (Figure\u00a01B). Hence, skulls spanning over 700 years, including the area\u2019s earliest and latest pre-Hispanic remains recovered to date, accompanied each of the main individuals. Seven of the skulls that accompanied PAPV109 belonged to individuals who pre-dated her by hundreds of years, and the other two were roughly contemporary. One of the crania buried with PAPV172 belonged to a male individual who lived roughly 500 years before her, and the other two to male individuals deceased and buried over the subsequent 300 years. Drawing upon on Cueva as well as Guna ethnography (Castillero Calvo, 2017: pp. 26, 87, 281, 282, 476\u2013478;Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo, 1853: Vol. 2, pp. 125\u2013154;Fortis, 2013), crania kept for hundreds of years or even deposited after the main interment probably pertained to enemy chiefs whose death in battle guaranteed their spirits\u2019 eternal repose. Their skulls may have provided sorcerers and healers, in this case female seers ortequina, a gateway to knowledge about enemies as well as the afterlife. These women entered the next world with the tools of their trade (the skulls), like other individuals interred in Panam\u00e1 Viejo (a \u201cmusician\u201d poised as if playing her instrument, and a seated adolescent with flint blades and stingray tail barbs) or mentioned in Spanish chronicles (farmers buried with corn) (Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo, 1853: pp. 125\u2013154). The heads of prestigious enemies obtained in warfare would have facilitated the seers\u2019 access to their strength and knowledge as well as their ability to communicate with other worlds. The different mtDNA lineages of these individuals might also support their origins from various pre-Hispanic groups, since we have found significant differences in the haplogroup distribution among the modern Indigenous populations analyzed here (p value\u00a0< 0.0001). Although the literature contains reference to wives, slaves, and loyal servants sacrificed with their chiefs (Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo, 1853;Romoli, 1987), these burials illustrate a different practice. Their arrangement stands out among a great diversity of pre-Hispanic interments over a wide zone of the Panamanian Pacific, some of these including offerings in local pottery, metal, lapidary, shell, and bone work, and many burial modes, including bones deposited in urns or bundles (Mart\u00edn, 2002a,2002b). PAPV172\u2019s head was found beneath a ceramic offering, while five ceramic pots with offerings accompanied PAPV109, who also wore a necklace fashioned from thorny oyster shells (Spondylusspp.). Within the variety of pre-Hispanic burial patterns observed to date, individuals PAPV109 and PAPV172 appear unique on a local as well as a regional level.",
            "The analyses conducted in this study facilitate a microgeographic and diachronic assessment of Indigenous autosomal variation in this strategic region. The characterization of the pre-colonial genetic histories is clouded by the impacts of colonization. This is evident in the distinctive genetic profiles that differentiate the current gene pool of the Panamanian groups as obtained by the ADMIXTURE analyses (Figures 2A,S2A, and S2B). The two groups that experienced a history of admixture, the self-identified \u201cMoreno\u201d and \u201cMestizo,\u201d reveal large proportions of their genomes not derived from Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Both show a comparable proportion of ancestry predominant in Europeans (K2) and the component common to Africans (K3) is more prevalent in the \u201cMoreno\u201d group; the \u201cMestizo\u201d are characterized by a component also identified in Asians (K4). The coexistence of different continental genomic ancestries is common in the Americas, due to complex admixture that started during the colonial period (Ongaro et\u00a0al., 2019). In Panama, where European colonization began in 1,502 CE, this is particularly evident in the \u201cMestizo,\u201d but it is also revealed by individuals who self-identified as Indigenous and genealogically unadmixed, showing variable amounts of African and European ancestries in their genomes, with the lowest average values in the Guna, followed by the Ng\u00e4be.",

The Indigenous groups from the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area form two closely related western clusters (one with the Ng\u00e4be and the other including Bribri, Naso, and Cab\u00e9car). The pre-Hispanic individuals group together in the middle of the Isthmo-Colombian genetic landscape and create a distinct branch in the outgroupf3statistics hierarchical tree, together with a few self-identified \u201cMoreno\u201d (Figure\u00a0S3A), suggesting the integration of pre-Hispanic individuals into the forming multi-cultural colonial groups. The genetic closeness of the pre-Hispanic individuals is possibly expected when considering the geographic proximity of the archaeological excavations but less expected when taking into account the radiocarbon dates, from 603 to 1,430 CE, thus revealing a genetic continuity for almost one thousand years (Table S1). The modern Indigenous populations from the Greater Dari\u00e9n area of cultural influence to the east of the region (Guna, Ember\u00e1, and northern Colombians) create distinct groups in the PCA plot, well separated from the Greater Chiriqu\u00ed populations in the west.",

            "The details of this genetic sub-structure (and heterogeneity) on the Isthmus became apparent by analyzing the nearly unadmixed Indigenous haplotypes (uIA217 dataset) with fineSTRUCTURE (Figures 3A andS4A). Among the five Isthmian genetic clusters, four are specific to Indigenous Panamanian groups (PaNASO, PaNGABE, PaEMBERA, PaGUNA), while the Bribri individuals form a separate cluster (here called Western Isthmus) with the Cab\u00e9car from Costa Rica. The latter branch, together with Naso and Ng\u00e4be, forms a macro-group that might be associated with the geographic region of the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area. Genetically distinct are the Ember\u00e1 and the Guna, suggesting a wider genetic variation in the Greater Dari\u00e9n cultural region. The Guna also show the highest level of similarity in intra- and inter-cluster comparisons (Figures 3B andS4B), analogous only to two Indigenous groups that experienced isolation events, the Amazonian Surui and Karitiana, and preserved an ancient Australasian-related ancestry, the so-called UPopY (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018;Skoglund et\u00a0al., 2015).

Here, we first confirmed that the previously discussed Isthmian component is also detectable in additional Chibchan-speaking populations genotyped with a different array (Arhuaco and Kogi from Colombia; Guaym\u00ed, Cab\u00e9car, Teribe, Bribri, Hu\u00ebtar, and Maleku from Costa Rica) and that its highest legacy can be detected in the western Isthmian land bridge consisting of the present-day countries of Panama and Costa Rica (Figure\u00a0S2C).

            "A pre-Hispanic origin of the Isthmo-Colombian distinctiveness is suggested by our analysis of effective population size based on the identical-by-descent (IBD) segments. A reduction in the population size of the Panamanian groups probably began during pre-colonial times (\u223c1 kya; inset ofFigure\u00a03C), thus before the average time of the other IA population groups taken together. This trend is mainly driven by the Guna, who on the other hand show unreliable population size (Ne) values when considering short fragments (<8 cM,Figure\u00a0S4C). Therefore, we repeated this analysis without the Guna, confirming an earlier beginning of the Ne reduction in the Panamanian IA groups that became steeper in colonial times (Figure\u00a0S4D). Finally, Ne estimates based on IBD longer (and more reliable) fragments (>8 cM) allowed us to confirm this trend for the Guna (Figure\u00a0S4E). Three factors may have contributed to this demographic pattern: (1) a decrease in the population size that started before European contact; (2) a less intensive impact of European colonialism, as also suggested by the lower peaks of IBD bins for most Panamanian groups; and (3) an earlier and steeper demographic recovery after contact than in other IA populations, especially evident in Guna and Ng\u00e4be who show an enrichment of shorter IBD segments, around 7\u201313 Mb, and then a fast decrease of IBD blocks (Figure\u00a03C). All explanations are plausible and not mutually exclusive. Before European contact,\u00a0cultural changes in the Panama Bay\u00a0region may have accompanied migrations and demographic shifts (see \u201cPanama: archaeology and history\u201d and, in theSTAR Methodssection, \u201cInsights into pre-Hispanic Panama\u201d). This possibility finds support from other genetic analyses that showed a high level of genomic drift shared by the Isthmian Indigenous groups, including the ancient individuals sampled, on both allele frequencies and haplotypes (see PCA plots and all the trees), as well as from the comparison of the IBD fragments shared among the Panamanian groups and with other IA populations (Figure\u00a0S4F). The latter analysis reveals ancient interactions (from at least 2,500 years ago) within the\u00a0Isthmo-Colombian area, much stronger and temporally extended among the western populations (Cab\u00e9car, Bribri, and Naso) currently living in the geographic region associated with the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area. On the eastern part of the Isthmus, the Guna also show a number of short (older) blocks shared with the Maya from Mexico, while the Ember\u00e1 share shorter blocks with South American populations. Thus, the former probably received ancient genetic inputs from the north, while the latter admixed with external southern sources. The Guna also show a direct connection with the ancestors of North and Central American populations in the TreeMix maximum likelihood (ML) tree when two migration edges (gene flows) are added (Figure\u00a05A). Such an ancient legacy is also confirmed by the Panamanian mtDNA tree. The most-represented haplogroups among ancient and modern Panamanian mitogenomes belong to the four main pan-American founding lineages (A2, B2, C1, and D1;Figure\u00a05B). We also identified four Isthmo-specific sub-branches, the most represented one (A2af1) is dated at 15.82 \u00b1 4.09 kya (Figure\u00a0S1A). Finally, the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) of Panamanian mtDNAs shows an increase in population size starting in the early Holocene (\u223c10 kya) (inset ofFigure\u00a05B).",

As expected, the Isthmus shows an excess of allele sharing with modern and ancient Indigenous populations from Central and South America when compared with Ancestral Beringia (USR-1, Upward Sun River, Alaska, \u223c11.5 kya) and NNA (represented by ASO, Ancient Southwestern Ontario, \u223c4.2 kya) genomes, but this picture is more intricate when dealing with the SNA-related ancient genomes (Table S4). The affinities between the (Y/tested) Isthmian populations and other Indigenous (X) groups are significantly stronger in relation to Anzick-1 (Montana, \u223c12.8 kya) than to Spirit Cave (Nevada, \u223c10.9 kya) (W individuals;Figure\u00a06A), suggesting that Isthmian populations are related to Spirit Cave as much as to other Indigenous groups, while Anzick-1 is an outgroup to them. We directly tested the relationships of Isthmian and other Central/South American populations with Anzick-1 and Spirit Cave, highlighting a differential trend that becomes significant with a higher molecular resolution power, i.e., more single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Figures 2C andS5C).

            "Such genomic differences are confirmed when moving southward in Central America (Table S4) and particularly for the early ancient genomes excavated on the southern continent. The Pacific coast populations (Los Rieles, Chile, \u223c10.9 kya) exhibit greater affinity to Spirit Cave, while the ancient genomes from the Atlantic side show the same pattern as Anzick-1 when considering individuals older than \u223c7 kya (Lagoa Santa, Brazil, \u223c10.4 kya). These distinctive signals persisted up to about 7 kya, when they were probably erased by a major population turnover in South America (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018;Posth et\u00a0al., 2018), facilitated by a widespread population decline due to mid-Holocene climate changes (Riris and Arroyo-Kalin, 2019).",
            "The results of previous analyses revealed that Isthmian and non-Isthmian IA populations are differentially related to available Pleistocene individuals, suggesting the contribution of different sources. To test whether the Isthmian and non-Isthmian groups derived from the same or distinct ancestral populations, we used qpWave (Patterson et\u00a0al., 2012), which estimates the minimum number of sources necessary to explain the observed genetic composition of population groups. Significance values are consistent with pairs of Isthmian and non-Isthmian groups deriving from at least two separate streams of ancestry, as attested by rank 1\u00a0p value\u00a0< 0.01 in most comparisons, especially for the Guna (Figure\u00a06B). This finding demonstrates that the distinctiveness of the Isthmo-Colombian area cannot be explained by genetic drift alone, as recently inferred in other population contexts (N\u00e4gele et\u00a0al., 2020). The Guna also show lower values (mostly <25thpercentile) of shared genetic history with ancient genomes representative of well-known Indigenous ancestries than the average of the one shared by other IA populations (Figure\u00a0S3D). Therefore, we modeled admixture graphs looking for the most plausible origin of the ancestral source(s) of the Isthmian component (Figures S6andS7; see also the specific section ofSTAR Methodsfor further details). The best supported topology successfully tested the hypothesis that the ancestral gene pool of the Isthmo-Colombian area, here represented by pre-Hispanic Panamanians, derives from a local admixture between different ancestral components (Figure\u00a07). One derives from the differential mixture of two ancestries, SNA1 and SNA2, that in turn stem from an ancestral SNA source. This scenario is strongly suggestive of the first split between SNA and NNA occurring in Beringia, thus further north than generally proposed (Waters, 2019). The NNA ancient individual inFigure\u00a07, ASO (\u223c4.2 kya), results from an admixture between NNA and SNA1. We could not identify an unadmixed proxy for the NNA ancestry among the available modern and ancient individuals (Figure\u00a0S6H), but NNA does not seem to be involved in shaping the Isthmian genomic pool. Founding populations carrying the SNA1 ancestry probably took part in an early peopling of the double continent passing through the Isthmus and leaving signals on both sides of South America, as attested by two of the most ancient genomes, Lagoa Santa in Brazil (\u223c10.4 kya) and Los Rieles in Chile (\u223c10.9 kya). The former also confirms a few traces of UPopY, the UPop of Australasian ancestry, which was previously proposed to have contributed to the early peopling of South America (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018;Skoglund et\u00a0al., 2015). On the other hand, only Los Rieles shows significant inputs of the SNA2 ancestry, which moved later or slower than SNA1 through the Americas, admixing multiple times with the first settlers along the way, as demonstrated by the ancient admixed genomes of Spirit Cave in North America and Mayahak Cab Pek (Belize, \u223c9.3 kya) and the ancient Isthmians (this study) in Central America. Once SNA2 reached South America, it probably left a stronger contribution on the Pacific side, as suggested by Los Rieles and supported by the differential pattern depicted by thef4statistics (Table S4). However, to fully explain the genetic variation of pre-Hispanic Panama, we need to consider an additional ancestry: an ancestral unsampled population of the Isthmus (UPopI;Figure\u00a07), which is still unrepresented in the ancient dataset, but left its strongest traces in the contemporary Guna. UPopI parallels the Spirit Cave branch of SNA2, testifying to a long-shared drift between the pre-Hispanic Guna and the ancient Isthmian (including pre-Hispanic) individuals sampled. This best-fitting model was also checked without considering UPopI and replacing Spirit Cave with Anzick-1 and Guna with Mixe, previously used to identify UPopA (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018), without finding any statistically supported graph (Figures S7D\u2013S7F). Therefore, it is supported that Anzick-1 and Spirit Cave might represent different ancestries and UPopI is a still unsampled population distinct from UPopA. UPopI likely originated in the north during the late Pleistocene, as attested by the age (\u223c15 kya,Figure\u00a0S1A) of the entire mtDNA haplogroup A2af1 that probably represents its mitochondrial legacy, and expanded more than 10 kya in the Isthmo-Colombian area (according to mitogenome data; inset ofFigure\u00a05B). These ancestries left different traces in pre-Hispanic Isthmian individuals and contemporary Panamanian groups (Figure\u00a07), and only the presence of UPopI provides significant support for our final model. It also explains the ancestral component, already seen in the ADMIXTURE analyses, which is geographically restricted to the Isthmo-Colombian area and prevalent in the Guna, where it was probably maintained by a high level of isolation. Finally, this specific ancestry could explain the \u201carchaeogenomic distinctiveness\u201d of the Isthmo-Colombian area within the genomic landscape of IA groups.",

The diachronic comparison with population groups presently living in Panama allowed us to identify genetic similarities with the Guna and Ng\u00e4be and suggestive connections with some admixed individuals, implying that, in the wake of the conquest, there was extensive gene flow. A genetic sub-structure has been identified in the entire Isthmo-Colombian region, with a macro-group encompassing the Cab\u00e9car, Bribri, Naso, and Ng\u00e4be, who currently live in the pre-colonial Greater Chiriqu\u00ed cultural area. A wider genetic variation characterizes eastern Panama, here represented by pre-Hispanic individuals from Panam\u00e1\u00a0Viejo and Coco del Mar plus Guna, Ember\u00e1, and northern Colombians. Our analyses suggest that pre-Hispanic demographic changes and isolation events, evident in the Guna, contributed to create the genetic structure currently seen in the region.

This component was present not only among pre-Hispanic Isthmian individuals but also strongly characterizes current Panamanian groups, particularly the Guna, surviving both pre-colonial demographic fluctuations and the genetic bottleneck (and admixture) caused by colonialism.",
            "The detection of this component has an impact that expands far beyond the Isthmo-Colombian area and the ancestry of its past and current inhabitants. The following clues point to the scenario that it arose in the late Pleistocene: (1) the pre-Clovis age of the Isthmian-specific mtDNA haplogroup A2af1, (2) the internal structure that emerges when only the Indigenous genome-wide variation is analyzed, (3) the longer shared genetic history among Isthmo-Colombian populations with respect to other Indigenous populations, and (4) the differential relationships with Pleistocene individuals from North America. Next, to identify its ancestral source(s), we built a statistically significant model that explains this Isthmo-Colombian component as a local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin. At least two SNA ancestries, SNA1 and SNA2, differentially associated to available Pleistocene genomes, should be considered, as well as an additional Isthmian-specific ancestry. The latter requires the contribution of UPopI, which stemmed from the same source (SNA2) that contributed to the pre-Clovis groups with Western Stemmed technologies associated with Spirit Cave and, according to mitogenome data, expanded within the Isthmo-Colombian area during the early Holocene.",
            "The ancestral admixtures described here were probably bound to now-submerged archeological sites on the Pacific coast of the Isthmus. Nevertheless, the genomes of the pre-Hispanic individuals from Panam\u00e1\u00a0Viejo and Coco del Mar attest to these events, and the site of Vampiros-1 (initially named Cueva de los Vampiros), the only Pleistocene site on the lower Isthmian land bridge that contains cultural, but not human, skeletal remains, provides further archeological support. Vampiros-1 shows evidence of both Clovis and Fluted Fishtail Point lithic traditions indicating that hunter-gatherers of extra-Isthmian origin were on the lower Isthmus 13.2\u201311.7 kya with specific composite weaponry and cutting/scraping tools (Ranere and Cooke, 2020). Our model also fits well with recent archeological records from both sides of the Isthmo-Colombian area. Archeological findings in southern North America report early peopling as far south as central northern Mexico around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Ardelean et\u00a0al., 2020) and more widespread settlements in warmer pre-Clovis times (14.7\u201312.9 kya) (Becerra-Valdivia and Higham, 2020). The cultural heterogeneity observed among the oldest reliable pre-Clovis archaeological sites of South America (dated 15.1\u201314.0 kya) along the Pacific coastal zone (Huaca Pietra in Central Andes; Monte Verde II in South Andes) (Dillehay et\u00a0al., 2017) and in the Pampas (Arroyo Seco 2) (Politis et\u00a0al., 2016) can be explained considering a deeper chronological time (between 16.6 and 15.1 kya) for the Isthmian crossing that led to the initial peopling of South America (Prates et\u00a0al., 2020).",
            "The preservation effect of an ancient legacy in \u201coutlier populations,\u201d such as the Guna, recalls that of Sardinians and Basques in Europe (Achilli et\u00a0al., 2004;Chiang et\u00a0al., 2018;Novembre et\u00a0al., 2008;Olivieri et\u00a0al., 2017;Palencia-Madrid et\u00a0al., 2017). In the European context, Sardinians maintained the most evident traces of the early European Neolithic farmers (Lazaridis et\u00a0al., 2014,2016;Raveane et\u00a0al., 2019). Among Indigenous peoples, some Amazonian groups, which match the very high internal similarities of the Guna, have preserved the specific ancestry of a UPop linked to Australasia (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018;Skoglund et\u00a0al., 2015). In the Isthmian context, demographic events connected to both pre-Hispanic and colonial times contributed to differentially retain and further shape the IA ancestries.",
            "The models reported in this study are based on 12 ancient low-coverage genomes from two archeological sites and genome-wide data from 74 unrelated modern Panamanians. These data provide a suggestive baseline for future interdisciplinary studies on the Isthmo-Colombian crossroads. High-coverage genomic data, from a wider time frame (since early Holocene to colonial times) and other archeological sites (across the entire Isthmo-Colombian area), as well as whole genomes from present-day individuals, are needed to continue to refine the region\u2019s genetic history. This additional work, with more statistical power and higher molecular resolution, will be essential to further detail the genetic patterns (and\u00a0ancestries) that we have identified in the Panamanian population(s) and to reconstruct variation in population sizes over time.",

            "From ca. 4.5 kya agriculture along Panama\u2019s Pacific watershed was complemented by fishing in rivers and estuaries, and catching birds, large snakes and iguanas (Iguanidae spp.), and hunting mammals with body masses\u00a0< 55\u00a0kg on the offshore Pearl Island archipelago (Cooke et\u00a0al., 2016). Some of these, e.g., white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and rodents including agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and paca (Cuniculus paca), forage in human trash and eat crops in gardens and fields (Cooke et\u00a0al., 2007,2008;Mart\u00ednez-Polanco et\u00a0al., 2020). OnPedro Gonzalez(Pearl Islands), a very small deer (Mazama sp.) (7-10\u00a0kg) was extirpated by hunting. Dolphins (Tursiops and Delphinus) were consumed 6.2-5.6 kya and were possibly killed when beached (Cooke et\u00a0al., 2016). Later, with the establishment of villages ca 4-2 kya, community activities diversified, especially regarding the exchange of goods. Hunting strategies now included communal drives in Pacific wooded savannas. Deer meat was stored salted and dried and then served at special feasts (Mart\u00ednez-Polanco and Cooke, 2019).",
            "Inhabitation of the Caribbean side of the Central American Isthmus (Costa Rica) began in the Late Pleistocene (13.4-12 kya) (Ranere and Cooke, 2020). In the very humid central Caribbean Panama, human activities date back to 5.9 kya when groups crossed the Central Cordillera to collect food and materials not available on the opposite side, e.g., embalming agents.",
            "On the central Caribbean, maize is found in rock shelters with earth ovens from about 3.5 kya. Materials analysis demonstrates that Monagrillo pottery found here was manufactured in the central Pacific watershed (Griggs, 2005;Iizuka et\u00a0al., 2014). One site in the coastal lowlands of Cocl\u00e9 province (Zapotal, PR-32), which used Monagrillo pottery, consisted of dwellings stratified within a shell-bearing midden accumulated between 4.3 and 3.2 kya. Zapotal has the characteristics of a small village. There are very large numbers of edge-ground cobbles here, which were used at many 8-3 kya sites in Panama for grinding several plant foods including maize and manioc. The abundance of small fish (< 300\u00a0g live weight) that were taken at Zapotal points to the use of tidal traps and weirs in the nearby estuary in order to maximize biomasses (Zohar and Cooke, 2019).",
            "By 3 kya notable differences had arisen in the material culture of a western region (Greater Chiriqu\u00ed; Chiriqu\u00ed and Bocas del Toro provinces) and a central region (Greater Cocl\u00e9; Cocl\u00e9, Azuero Peninsula and Veraguas provinces). Greater Chiriqu\u00ed shows material culture, art, genes and language that are broadly consistent (Ulloa, 2017), in distinction to the Greater Cocl\u00e9 or the even more diverse, but less studied, Greater Dari\u00e9n.",
            "Unique ceremonial and religious precincts stand out in both the Chiriqu\u00ed and Cocl\u00e9 cultural areas, although they are markedly different: Barriles in highland Chiriqu\u00ed (Linares et\u00a0al., 1975), and the twin sites of Sitio Conte and El Ca\u00f1o in the Pacific Cocl\u00e9 lowlands. The ceremonial site at Barriles consists of low platforms, boulder petroglyphs, urn burials, large statues depicting one man sitting on another\u2019s shoulders\u2013in an apparent display of social dominance\u2013and an enormous maize-grinding stone (metate) showing explicit iconographic connections between maize and human fertility (Linares et\u00a0al., 1975). Maize, beans (Phaseolusspp,), and palm and tree fruits characterize the samples of carbonized plant remains in the middens in domestic areas (Dickau, 2010;Smith, 1980).",
            "The Barriles ceremonial precinct seems to have served many communities located between 1,000 and 2,300\u00a0m above sea level in the shadow of the Bar\u00fa volcano, which last erupted 0.5 kya (Holmberg, 2007). It is inferred that Barriles was the initial settlement of a cultural group that first entered this highland zone from elsewhere ca 2.8 kya. Friction led to fission. A sector of the colonizing population moved to Cerro Punta and henceforth maintained vacillating relations with its ancestors (\u201cpeace, trade, war\u201d). Communion among the entire descent group was not severed. Periodically, perhaps annually, festivals were held at ancestral Barriles. The feats of the founders and supernatural helpers were celebrated. Large quantities of alcoholic beverages (e.g., maize and palm sap) were likely brewed.",
            "The well-studied heritage of Greater Cocl\u00e9, which reached its apogee at the great ceremonial and burial precincts of Sitio Conte and El Ca\u00f1o 1.5\u20130.95 kya (Lothrop, 1937,1942;Mayo Torn\u00e9, 2015), confirms a continuity of iconography and symbolism on decorated pottery from 2.5 kya until two decades after Spanish conquest in this central region. But whether this area was also linguistically united cannot yet be determined.",
            "Cultural geography becomes even more complex in the Greater Dari\u00e9n area extending from the El Valle Pleistocene volcano to eastern Dari\u00e9n. Historians and most archaeologists agree that by 1,500 CE the eastern region, and possibly much of the central area, was inhabited by speakers of the Cueva language. Historian Kathleen Romoli and linguists Jacob Loewen and Adolfo Costenla have proposed for many years that the group of settlements that at the time of Spanish conquest spoke the \u201clanguage of Cueva\u201d were not an \u201cethnic group\u201d but, rather, a collection of settlements that shared the Cueva language as alingua franca. These three researchers also argue that some polities in fact spoke variants of languages in the Chocoan family, especially those on the Pacific side of the Isthmus (Costenla, 2012;Loewen, 1963;Romoli, 1987). Chibchan languages probably derive from a proto-language that coalesced about 10 kya (O\u2019Connor and Muysken, 2014) in a \u201ccore area\u201d on the lower Central American Isthmus (southern Costa Rica and western central Panama). Ever sinceBarrantes et\u00a0al. (1990)conducted an isozyme-based study of modern Central American Indigenous polities that spoke languages in the Nuclear Chibchan family (Costenla, 2012), it has been apparent that this population coalesced very early in the Holocene and at the onset of agriculture gradually experiencedin situfission and fusion.",
            "Ceramics found in eastern Panama point to greater proximity to the Greater Cocl\u00e9 tradition than a putative Gran Dari\u00e9n cultural sphere among the peoples who inhabited this region from 200 BCE to 1200 CE. Recent findings on the Pearl Islands archipelago confirm the expansion of the ceramic style known as Cubit\u00e1, as well as molded and incised variations of the Conte style, both from the central region of Gran Cocl\u00e9 in the gulf of Panam\u00e1 (Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2016). Biese had already suggested that this expansion reachedPanam\u00e1 Viejo, where he reported examples of the Conte style excavated around Puente del Rey, toward the north of the site (Biese, 1964).",
            "At the Miraflores site on the Banks of the Bayano River (Cooke, 1976;Oyuela-Calcedo and Raymond, 1998), 670\u20131015 CE and 700\u20131030 CE according to the latest 2 sigma calibrations (Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2016), only one piece made in the region exhibited painted decorations with obvious influences from Greater Cocl\u00e9: a plate with a tripod pedestal with the effigy of a monkey (Cooke, 1998). The same pattern of cultural replacement is documented on the Pearl Islands archipelago, where the islands\u2019 Fifth Ceramic Horizon is identified from 750 through 1350 CE (Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2016). This late ceramic configuration, which features incised decoration and molding procedures different from its immediate precedents, is that which archaeologists normally associate with Greater Darien, the region that sixteenth-century Spanish chroniclers described as populated by communities that spoke the \u201cCueva language\u201d from Urab\u00e1 to the eastern slope of the El Valle volcano (Mart\u00edn, 2002b;Romoli, 1987).",
            "Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al. (2016)argue that the discrepancy between the Greater Darien and Greater Cocl\u00e9 cultural areas, whose geographical extension may have shifted over time, could derive from a change in the population inhabiting the Pearl Islands archipelago: the group using Cubit\u00e1 ceramics and Conte variations may have ceded before the entry of a population with a very different ceramic tradition from the Darien region and related to northwest Colombia. Another hypothesis (Cooke, 1998;Mart\u00edn and S\u00e1nchez, 2007;S\u00e1nchez-Herrera and Cooke, 2000) relates the changes observed to a reorganization of the commercial routes and exchanges from 500 CE, which intensified after 800-900 CE, with the introduction of metallurgy to the isthmus and the replacement of shell artifacts with those of gold to represent high social status. From at least the beginning of the common era through the end of its first millennia, the dispersion of Cubit\u00e1 ceramics allude to the fact that the Pearl Islands archipelago, the Azuero Peninsula and the central coast of the bay of Panama participated in the same sphere of social interaction. This relationship changed completely in the subsequent period, and until European contact.",
            "The uneven impact of European colonization and the upheaval it induced, in addition to subsequent migrations, show that comprehensive and detailed studies of this time period need to be completed in this region to help trace population histories of Indigenous groups before and after 1500 CE. Although goods also crossed the isthmus in pre-colonial times, the process intensified after the early sixteenth century, when the Spanish established settlements on both sides of the Isthmus to forge a highway for the global transit (and often forced mobility) of persons and goods between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.",
            "In order to assess change and continuity in the most radically transformed area of the Isthmus, the under-studied eastern region, 20 ancient individuals (21 specimens in total, sometimes referred as ancient Panamanians for the sake of clarity) were collected from seven different archaeological excavations (six of these within today\u2019sPatronato Panam\u00e1 Viejo, and one at nearbyCoco del Mar) (Figure\u00a01A;Table S1). Based on the style of the ceramics recovered, archaeologists consider the area related to contiguous contemporary settlements as part of an extended pre-Hispanic presence of Cueva-speakers within the Greater Darien cultural region (Mart\u00edn, 2002b). This population coexisted and mixed with Spanish settlers from 1519 to 1541 Common Era (CE), as an Indigenous presence among Old Panama\u2019s earliest Christian burials suggests. The excavations sampled took place in and near Panam\u00e1 Viejo, the site of the colonial city from 1519 through 1671 CE, and an area of pre-Hispanic occupation before that.",

Scholars have awaited genetic research in order to test the hypothesized relationships regarding the individuals buried within this tomb since its discovery in 1996 (Mendizabal, 2004). DNA was successfully extracted from the main individual (PAPV109) and three of the nine skulls (PAPV114, 117 and 118) around her.

Trimmed reads were mapped against the human reference genome hg19 build 37.1, as well as versus the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) in separate runs, using the algorithmalnof bwa v0.6.1 (Li and Durbin, 2010). The numerous duplicates, generated during library amplification, were removed with the tool MarkDuplicates of the Picard package (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard).",
            "Ancient DNA damage pattern.Damage patterns (Table S2) were analyzed with MapDamage2.0 (J\u00f3nsson et\u00a0al., 2013). The molecular decay after death was calculated from the length of the reads, as in (Allentoft et\u00a0al., 2012). We used the error rate estimate to confirm the antiquity of our reads (Table S2). It calculates the excess of derived alleles observed in an ancient genome (compared to a high-quality genome) taking into account that all the anatomically modern humans should have the same percentage of derived alleles. The error rate analysis was performed comparing our trimmed FASTQ with the \u201cError estimation\u201d tool of ANGSD (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data) (Korneliussen et\u00a0al., 2014), using the chimp genome as an outgroup and the genome NA12778 (from the 1000 genomes project), as an error-free individual (Schroeder et\u00a0al., 2018).",
            "To double-check if an excess of damage and/or erroneous adapters\u2019 trimming might affect the results of the subsequent analyses, we repeated two AncientPanama FASTQ trimming using more stringent criteria: removing 10 additional bases from both ends of each read; removing the adapters using a higher mismatch rate (up to 50%) than in the original pipeline (20%). These trimmed FASTQ were then mapped against the reference genome hg19 build 37.1. We repeated the specific Isthmo-Colombian PCA analysis including the Ancient Panamanian data trimmed with more stringent criteria finding consistent results with the original plot inFigure\u00a02B.",
            "Chromosome X contamination.For each library derived from ancient male individuals we estimated nuclear contamination using the approach described inMoreno-Mayar et\u00a0al. (2020), based on reads mapping to the X chromosome. This method relies on the fact that males are hemizygous for X-linked loci outside the pseudo-autosomal regions, making multiple alleles in these loci attributable to either errors or contaminations. These estimates can be used as proxy for nuclear contamination estimates in ancient male individuals.",
            "We used ANGSD (Korneliussen et\u00a0al., 2014) to estimate contamination on reads with mapping quality greater than 30 and base quality greater than 20. We considered at least 100 sites with depth greater than or equal to 2 (N\u00e4gele et\u00a0al., 2020) matching the HapMap CEU allele frequencies (Altshuler et\u00a0al., 2010) as potential contaminants, after excluding pseudo-autosomal regions on chromosome X. We then applied the tool presented inMoreno-Mayar et\u00a0al. (2020)to estimate contamination using low-depth X chromosome data, setting to 1,000 the maximum number of jackknife samples used for estimating standard errors and considering the estimates from the Two-consensus method.",
            "Mitochondrial DNA contamination.Jones\u2019s method: Contamination in ancient mitochondrial sequences was first estimated by assessing the number of non-consensus base calls (with base quality greater than or equal to 20) at haplogroup diagnostic positions as a function of the total coverage for each of these sites (Jones et\u00a0al., 2017).",
            "contamMix: We also estimated mtDNA contamination in our data by using contamMix v. 1.0-10, which provides the maximuma posterioriprobability of the consensus sequence being authentic (Fu et\u00a0al., 2013). This method is based on the reconstructed mtDNA consensus to estimate contamination, which should not exceed 50% for contamMix to work. First, we built an mtDNA consensus sequence running ANGSD (Korneliussen et\u00a0al., 2014) and using the parameters -doCounts 1 and -doFasta 2 (majority rule). We retained only reads with mapping quality higher than 30 and nucleotides with base quality greater than 20. Moreover, we filtered for sites with a minimum depth of 5X. Then, we remapped to the rebuilt consensus sequence only the reads that mapped uniquely to the mitochondrial reference sequence. We used mafft (Katoh et\u00a0al., 2002;Katoh and Standley, 2013) to align our consensus sequence to a panel of 311 worldwide mtDNA sequences (Green et\u00a0al., 2008), representing potential contaminant sequences. Finally, we used both the alignment and the remapped reads for contamination estimation with contamMix, running five independent chains for 50,000 iterations. The results were checked by monitoring the Gelman diagnostic (Gelman and Rubin, 1992) to confirm convergence.",
            "Schmutzi: The third method to estimate mtDNA contamination was Schmutzi (Renaud et\u00a0al., 2015), which jointly estimates present-day human contamination and reconstructs the endogenous mitochondrial sequence by considering both deamination patterns and fragment length distributions. Present-day human contamination was evaluated by an iterative likelihood method implemented in Schmutzi using a non-redundant database of 197 human mitogenomes available in the software package.",
            "The sex of each individual was determined using two computational approaches specific for low-coverage genomes, Ry (Skoglund et\u00a0al., 2013) and Rx (Mittnik et\u00a0al., 2016) (Table S2). The relationships between the ancient Isthmian individuals were verified using the tool READ with default parameters (Monroy Kuhn et\u00a0al., 2018) (Table S2).",
            "The reference bias indicates an increased probability of detecting the alleles present in the reference sequence, especially when dealing with paleogenomic data affected by fragmentation and other post-mortem damage, often generating C to T and G to A transitions at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragment ends (Type II damage) (G\u00fcnther and Nettelblad, 2019). These characteristics might influence mapping scores in low-coverage ancient genomes, particularly for those reconstructed from very short reads, eventually leading to an artificial decrement of reads carrying alternative alleles, in comparison to high-coverage modern genomes. In order to verify that this issue did not affect our downstream analyses, we compared the alternative allele frequency distributions between modern and ancient individual data. We used the PLINK 2.0 toolset to calculate the average proportion of alternative alleles for each individual. This analysis was repeated considering all SNPs, all SNPs without C to T and G to A and only transversions without finding significant differences between the pseudo-haploid datasets (derived from ancient and masked individuals).",

Considering that Indigenous populations have a higher degree of relatedness due to long periods of isolation and endogamy, there was the need to evaluate a different threshold. For this reason, the 97.5-percentile of population IBD for each population was used as threshold for exclusion (Busby et\u00a0al., 2015). For each pair of related individuals, the exclusion was based on the number of missing SNPs. A total of 74 individuals (out of the initial 84) were retained after quality and kinship filters.",

The calling was performed for all individuals in one run using ANGSD (Korneliussen et\u00a0al., 2014) with thehaplocall 1option, which picks a random read starting from an input set. In addition, to avoid possible biases due to low coverage data, we down-sampled all ancient genomes to 1X and 0.5X coverage using ANGSD with the-downSampleoption.",

The individuals used for the latter dataset were considered pseudo-haploid in allele frequency analyses, while in haplotype-based methods the individual chromosome pairs were jointly analyzed. Moreover, some of the samples with less than 50% Indigenous ancestry were removed (rmIA311).",

Therefore, the analyses of pre-colonial genetic history might be strongly influenced by these components and it is very difficult to find non-admixed modern individuals, even within Indigenous groups. Thus, three different approaches (ADMIXTURE, Local Ancestry andf4) have been used to create a sub-set of individuals with the maximum possible Indigenous genetic component, to avoid signals altered by recent admixture events. Considering the inconsistency of the preliminary results obtained by using the three methods independently, a stepwise merging approach was preferred, retaining individuals classified as Indigenous (with the lowest content of non-Indigenous component) after each step.",

Among these, we selected 58 individuals to be used as ancestral source in LA analysis. The overall criteria used to select these 58 ancestral individuals were as follows: i) successfully passing thef4filter (see \u201cf4 statistics\u201d section); ii) 100% IA in K14 (see \u201cADMIXTURE\u201d section); iii) belonging to a population that best represents a specific IA component in the ADMIXTURE analysis (Figure\u00a0S2A) for each K (until K20):",

BEAST runs were performed with complete mtDNA sequences under the HKY substitution model (gamma-distributed rates plus invariant sites) with a fixed molecular clock as in (Brandini et\u00a0al., 2018). We set the clock rate considering the ones published inPosth et\u00a0al. (2016)andSoares et\u00a0al. (2009).

The same BEAST settings were used to: i) estimate the ages of haplogroups and (ii) evaluate population expansions in Panama through BSPs (Drummond et\u00a0al., 2005) by including all Panamanian Indigenous mitogenomes analyzed in this study. BSPs were visualized in a plot using Tracer v1.7 (Rambaut et\u00a0al., 2018) and converted into an excel graph by assuming a generation time of 25 years as inBrandini et\u00a0al. (2018).

            "In particular, to specifically check for the relationships between Anzick-1 and Spirit Cave, with the Isthmian populations as well as with other ancient and modern IA individuals from Central and South America, we ran twof4statistics in the following formsf4(Anzick-1, Spirit Cave; Isthmo, Mbuti) andf4(Anzick-1, Spirit Cave; Central and South IA, Mbuti). The datasets uIA89, mIA417 and ancient individuals were used considering different sets of variants: all SNPs, all SNPs without C to T and G to A variants, only transversions and only transversion with ancient individuals\u2019 coverage downsampled to a maximum of 1X (to avoid coverage biases).",
            "We observed a clear pattern that becomes significant when increasing the number of SNPs. We further verified this pattern using af4statistics in the formf4(USR-1, Anzick-1/Spirit Cave; Central and South IA, Mbuti) that confirmed a higher proximity to Spirit Cave in comparison to Anzick-1. The same pattern has been also observed in the outgroupf3analyses (see above).",

We observed that one ancestry is usually needed (p value > 0.01) to define pairs of Isthmo-Colombian populations, while pairs of Isthmian and non-Isthmian populations require two ancestries. This pattern is more evident in the Guna, the best representative of the Isthmo-Colombian component. This pattern confirms that a different ancestry, instead of only genetic drift by isolation, is needed to explain the distinctiveness of the Isthmo-Colombian populations.",
            "We usedqpGraph(Patterson et\u00a0al., 2012), on a merged dataset of the uIA89, mIA417 and ancient individuals (considering only transversions), to reconstruct the best tree modeling the relationships between Isthmian populations and ancient Indigenous genomes. In ourf4statistics we noted a differential relationship between Isthmian groups and modern/ancient Indigenous Americans in comparison to the individuals older than 10 kya (Figure\u00a06A;Table S4). Therefore, we modeled a basal tree with three of the most ancient available genomes of the SNA ancestry, an ancestry that certainly went through the Isthmus to reach South America. Our best tree revealed that the SNA dispersal involved a complex demographic pattern, with three possible ancestries (Figure\u00a0S6A). To resolve the inferred zero-length internal branch, we tested all three possible split orders obtaining similar scores. Therefore, it might represent a very short branch that we cannot resolve with this dataset power (Lipson, 2020) and the three lineages, Anzick-1 (Montana, \u223c12.6 kya), Lagoa Santa (Brazil, \u223c10.4 kya; SNA1) and Spirit Cave (Nevada, \u223c10.9 kya; SNA2) are statistically consistent with forming a trifurcation. The best fitting topology was tested by considering an early admixture between the SNA2 source and SNA1 obtaining a still supported model without zero-length branches (Figure\u00a0S6B). To increase the resolution power and considering the results of previous analyses (f3-andf4-statistics), we added to this graph the captured and genotyped data from Lapa do Santos (Brazil, \u223c9.6 kya) as SNA1 and the whole-genome sequences of ESN (California; \u223c4-5 kya) as SNA2. This allowed us also to check for any bias due to sequencing methods. Even in this case the best fit tree confirms the trifurcation (Figure\u00a0S6C). After this step, we added Los Rieles (Chile, \u223c10.9 kya), the most ancient Pacific coast genome, which turned out to be better modeled as an admixture of SNA1 and SNA2 (|Z|\u00a0= 2.835) than as non-admixed and considering only geographic origins (|Z|\u00a0= 3.930) (Figure\u00a0S6D). This finding confirms that both SNA1 and SNA2 reached South America and seems to indicate that the latter had a lower impact on the Atlantic side of South America. When Los Rieles is replaced by Lapa do Santos, the tree does not fit (|Z|\u00a0= 3.930) (Figure\u00a0S6E).",
            "We then took into account that, in thef4statistics (Figure\u00a06A;Table S4), there is a significant allele sharing of the Isthmian populations with Spirit Cave and two Central American ancient genomes, Mayahak Cab Pek (Belize, \u223c9.3 kya) and Saki Tzul (Belize, \u223c7.4 kya), as well as a higher genetic proximity to Los Rieles relative to Lagoa Santa. Therefore, we attempted to model ancient Panama in relation to these ancient genomes (Figures S6F and S6G). Ancient Panama fits better when considering an admixture between the Central-South American branch of SNA2 and another ancestry parallel to SNA2 and shows the best score with Mayahak Cab Pek (Figure\u00a0S6G). The additions of NNA individuals (Figure\u00a0S6H), ASO (Ancient Southwestern Ontario, \u223c4.2 kya), 939 (Lucy Island, British Columbia, \u223c6.1 kya), Kennewick (Washington State, \u223c8.8 kya), ancient Athabaskan (dated 100 and 725 ya), and modern Chipewyan, hold better when assuming some admixture events involving these genomes. These findings confirm that we cannot identify an unadmixed proxy for the NNA ancestry among ancient individuals. The best graph was obtained when including ASO as NNA and Mayahak Cab Pek as the central American ancient genome.",
            "At this point, we further evaluated the relationship of Panama with SNA1 that we initially linked to Lagoa Santa (Figure\u00a0S6A). As before, we started from basal admixture graphs without Guna and considered the conformation with ASO and Mayahak Cab Pek, based on previous results (Figure\u00a0S6H). We first tested the tree without admixture in Los Rieles, placing Lagoa Santa as a parallel branch of SNA2, but the tree would fit only when considering Los Rieles as an admixture between SNA1 and SNA2 (|Z|\u00a0= 2.896), the two early South American ancestries that we identified above (Figure\u00a0S7A). It is worth mentioning, however, that the graph without admixture in Los Rieles became statistically significant (|Z|\u00a0< 3) when Lagoa Santa was replaced with the younger Laranjal sample (Brazil, \u223c6.8 kya) (Figure\u00a0S7B). This confirms ourf4statistics (Figure\u00a06A;Table S4) and the scenario of a widespread population turnover in South American during mid-Holocene, as previously suggested (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018;Posth et\u00a0al., 2018), a finding that also correlates with climate changes in the southern continent (Riris and Arroyo-Kalin, 2019). As for the Ancient Panamanians, they are a mix between the source of SNA2 (prior to Spirit Cave) and the admixture between SNA1 and SNA2 (Figure\u00a0S7A).",
            "Lastly, we assessed different admixture graphs also including the Guna, which was the best representative of the Isthmian-specific component in our previous analyses (Figure\u00a02A). As for the ancient Isthmians, we first explored the link of Guna with SNA2 (i.e., Spirit Cave) and in this setting only the admixed model was supported, with the Guna group representing a still unsampled population of the Isthmus, UPopI (Figure\u00a0S7B). To assess if UPopI might correspond to the previously identified UPopA, we replaced Guna with Mixe, previously used to identify UPopA (Moreno-Mayar et\u00a0al., 2018). The resulting admixture graph was not statistically supported (|Z| > 3, the rightmost graph). Then, we linked Guna also to SNA1, obtaining the best Z score in the graph when UPopI was placed as a parallel ancestry to SNA1 and SNA2, all radiating from the same early SNA source (Figure\u00a0S7C). The latter derives from an initial split of the early Indigenous group into SNA and NNA. In this scenario the ASO group is the result of an admixture between NNA and SNA1. It is therefore likely that the first split occurred further north and earlier than the diversification of SNA into SNA1 e SNA2. Finally, the same graph shows that when UPopI reached the Isthmian area, it admixed locally with population groups derived from both SNA1 and SNA2.",
            "Taking into account the presence of a zero-length internal branch in the final tree with UPopI (Figure\u00a0S7C) and the results obtained on the basal graph (Figure\u00a0S6), we modeled a binary tree without zero-length branches when considering an initial migration of population with an early SNA ancestry (SNA1) and a later North American admixture between SNA1 and a different SNA branch (SNA2) (Figure\u00a07). This admixture gave rise to two ancestries, one, related to Spirit Cave, that reached South America, leaving evident footprints on the Pacific coast, and another restricted to the Isthmo-Colombian area (UPopI) that is well represented in the Guna. The best topologies were also checked replacing Guna (UPopI) with Mixe (UPopA), Spirit Cave with Anzick-1, and without UPopI (Figures S7D\u2013S7F), but no statistically supported graphs were found. The other Isthmian Indigenous groups were also tested (replacing ancient Isthmians) using this final model (Z score always\u00a0< 2.5) to estimate the differential legacy of the three ancestries in present-day populations (inset ofFigure\u00a07).",
            "Phased haplotypes were generated from the rWD1560 dataset using the Segmented Haplotype Estimation and Imputation tool SHAPEITv2 (Delaneau et\u00a0al., 2011) and the HapMap37 human genome build 37 recombination map.",
            "The local ancestry for genomic fragments in the American individuals was estimated using RFMix (Maples et\u00a0al., 2013). As source populations, we used Bantu, Esan (ESN), Gambia (GWDwg), Mandenka, Mbuti and Yoruba (YRI) for Africa, Spanish (IBS), British (GBR), French, Icelandic and Tuscany (TSI) for Europe and Chipewyan, Kichwa Orellana, PaGUNA, Puno, Surui and Karitiana for Indigenous ancestry. We used \u201cPopPhased,\u201d \u201c-n 5\u201d and \u201c\u2013forward-backward\u201d options as recommended in RFMix manual. Then, starting from RFMix output files, we built a PLINK file set in which the non-Indigenous SNPs were masked. The masking process was done with this rationale: if in the \u201cViterbi\u201d output a particular SNP was not assigned to the Indigenous ancestry and if the probability of belonging to the Indigenous ancestry (reported in the \u201cforwardbackward\u201d output) was less than a threshold (< 0.9) that allele was set as missing. In this analysis we kept individuals as separated into the two phased haplotypes.",
            "To obtain the painting profile of all the 217 individuals in the uIA217 dataset consisting in a matrix of \u2018recipient\u2019 individuals (rows) that appear as a mosaic of the \u2018donors\u2019 (columns), we processed the genomic information contained in phased data (haplotypes) through the use of inferential algorithms implemented in CHROMOPAINTERv2 (Lawson et\u00a0al., 2012). Technically for this analysis the recombination (-n) and mutation (-m) parameters used were respectively 233.1352 and 0.00084 estimated on five randomly selected chromosomes (3, 7, 10, 18 and 22). Since the genetic variability among IA populations is low, we ran CHROMOPAINTER in two runs, one with standard parameters, the other adding the flag -k 50 (Gnecchi-Ruscone et\u00a0al., 2019). No significant differences were observed between the two runs.",
            "The CHROMOPAINTER square (217\u00a0\u00d7 217 individuals)chunkcounts.outmatrix was used as input file for fineSTRUCTURE in order to identify similar genetic clusters. We ran the software with three millions MCMC iterations thinned every 10,000 and preceded by one million burn in iterations: -x 1000000 ; -y 3000000 ; -z 10000 ; -t 1000000. The MCMC file (.xml) was used to build the tree structure using both the options \u2013T1 and \u2013T3, without major changes between the two methods.",
            "Initially, we obtained 50 clusters in the final tree (data not shown). However, to obtain more robust genetic inferences the number of clusters was reduced to 19 considering the number of individuals in each cluster (less than five) and the Total Variation Distance (TVD\u00a0< 0.03) as elimination criteria. TVD is an index that measures the similarity between copying vectors of the CHROMOPAINTER matrix (calculated on the chunklengths) (Leslie et\u00a0al., 2015); lower values of TVD mean similarity, while higher values indicate heterogeneity.",
            "The masked haplotypes (mIA417) were initially filtered for the individuals that had a maximum of 50% of missing SNPs (considered as the mean of the summed missingness of the two haplotypes) and, among these individuals, we selected only those with at least 25% of SNPs retained in each haplotype. Eventually, we obtained a restricted dataset of 311 masked individuals (rmIA311). This dataset (rmIA311) was then converted in PLINK1.9 format and subsequently in a CHROMOPAINTERv2 input. To enable missing data in CHROMOPAINTERv2, we slightly modified CHROMOPAINTERv2 such that a recipient/target\u2019s emission probability is set to 0 at missing (i.e., masked) SNPs when tabulating the expected number of segments matched to each \u201cDonor\u201d individual that the recipient is compared to. Therefore, in regions of high missingness the expected number of segments matched to each \u201cDonor\u201d will tend toward the prior, which assumes equal matching to all \u201cDonor\u201d individuals. However, in our application here we found that inference seems to be dominated by data at non-missing SNPs, where the usual CHROMOPAINTERv2 machinery is employed. In particular, we did not identify any correlation between the percentage of missing data (even when reaching 50%) and bad placements/outlier behaviors in the PCA created from the CHROMOPAINTER output projecting the \u2018masked\u2019 individuals (Figure\u00a0S4A).",
            "The pattern of IBD sharing within each population of the uIA217 phased dataset was analyzed using Refined-IBD (Browning and Browning, 2013), which makes it possible to improve the accuracy and efficiency of identity by descent detection in population data, using default parameters. The average IBD-sharing was calculated for nine different bin categories corresponding to different degrees of relatedness (Gnecchi-Ruscone et\u00a0al., 2019;Moreno Estrada et\u00a0al., 2014). The total length of shared IBD was calculated for each bin, by considering all pairs of individuals within each population group. The summed length was then divided by the numbers of pairs in each population in order to obtain the average total length of intrapopulation IBD shared blocks for each population in the uIA217 dataset (y axis inFigure\u00a03C).",
            "In order to reconstruct the population dynamics, we applied IBDne on the uIA217 dataset, using both IBDseq, which does not require phased data, and Refined-IBD that uses phased data, using different minimum thresholds of IBD segment length (2 and 4 centimorgan, cM). Considering all the Panamanian individuals, lower confidence intervals were obtained when using windows of 2 cM. Moreover, the Ne obtained with Refined-IBD is more compatible with historical estimates of the area\u2019s pre-colonial population size (see introduction). We observed the same trend in the ancestry-specific effective population size (asIBDne) from the 74 Panamanian individuals, masked for the IA component, following the pipeline presented byBrowning et\u00a0al. (2018), as reported inOngaro et\u00a0al. (2019). Therefore, Refined-IBD was applied using 2 cM windows for the comparison between Panamanian and non-Panamanian IA individuals present in the uIA217 dataset (insetFigure\u00a03C). This analysis shows a decrease in the region\u2019s population size that pre-dates the average values of other IA populations considered together. This decrease started in pre-Hispanic times (\u223c1100 ya) then became steeper in the early colonial period (\u223c500 ya). To retain more information, we used the three macro-clusters from the fineSTRUCTURE tree: Guna (30 individuals), Ember\u00e1 (18 individuals) and Western Panama (20 individuals) encompassing Bribri, Naso and Ng\u00e4be. The Guna group shows a peculiar trend when considering shorter IBD fragments\u00a0< 6 cM (Figure\u00a0S4C). However, even when the Guna were removed from the Panamanian / non-Panamanian comparison, the peculiar pre-Hispanic demographic contraction of the Panamanian populations was still detectable and with smaller confidence intervals (Figure\u00a0S4D). The same approach was applied including all of the macro-clusters obtained with fineSTRUCTURE and considering a minimum threshold of 8 cM. This analysis confirmed the behavior of the Isthmian groups including the Guna (Figure\u00a0S4E).",
            "In order to date the admixture events between our Panamanian groups and other IA populations included in the uIA217 dataset, we calculated the IBD sharing segments using RefineIBD as performed byLiu et\u00a0al. (2020). The IBD blocks were divided into three categories, based on their length (1-5 cM, 5-10 cM and over 10 cM), each roughly representing different time periods: 1,500-2,500 ya, 500-1,500 ya and\u00a0< 500 ya (Liu et\u00a0al., 2020;Ralph and Coop, 2013). We have calculated the mean of summed IBD lengths shared between population pairs for each length category. To reduce noise and false positives only the pairs that shared at least two blocks > 5 cM and four\u00a0< 5 cM were considered.",

            "Recent aDNA studies are progressively focusing on various Neolithic and Hunter - Gatherer (HG) populations, providing arguments in favor of major migrations accompanying European Neolithisation. The major focus was so far on the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), which introduced the Neolithic way of life in Central Europe in the second half of 6th millennium BC. It is widely agreed that people of this culture were genetically different from local HGs and no genetic exchange is seen between the two groups. From the other hand some degree of resurgence of HGs genetic component is seen in late Neolithic groups belonging to the complex of the Funnel Beaker Cultures (TRB). Less attention is brought to various middle Neolithic cultures belonging to Late Danubian sequence which chronologically fall in between those two abovementioned groups. We suspected that genetic influx from HG to farming communities might have happened in Late Danubian cultures since archaeologists see extensive contacts between those two communities.",
            "Here we address this issue by presenting 5 complete mitochondrial genomes of various late Danubian individuals from modern-day Poland and combining it with available published data. Our data show that Late Danubian cultures are maternally closely related to Funnel Beaker groups instead of culturally similar LBK.",
            "We assume that it is an effect of the presence of individuals belonging to U5 haplogroup both in Late Danubians and the TRB. The U5 haplogroup is thought to be a typical for HGs of Europe and therefore we argue that it is an additional evidence of genetic exchange between farming and HG groups taking place at least as far back as in middle Neolithic, in the Late Danubian communities.",

            "The Danubian Neolithic is a sequence of archaeological cultures that emerged around 5600/5500 BC in the Transdanubia region of western Hungary from the preceding Vinca, Starcevo and K\u00f6ros cultures [1]. The Neolithisation of Central Europe by people of the Linear Pottery Culture, better known as the Linearbandkeramik culture (LBK), is a well-investigated phenomenon, both archaeologically and genetically. Nowadays it is agreed by both archaeologists [2,3] and geneticists [4\u20137] that the rapid spread of the LBK in the second half of 6th millennium BC was one of the major migration events that shaped the European gene pool.",
            "The archaeologists see the LBK as one of the stages of migration process originating in Near East, that spread north- and west-wards gradually introducing the Neolithic way of life in Europe [8]. However some archaeological data also points to involvement of local Hunter-Gatherers (HGs) in the formation of the LBK and its eastern variant the Alf\u00f6ld Linear Pottery (ALP) culture from Star\u010dcevo and K\u00f6r\u00f6s cultures [9]. The relatively rapid pace of the spread of the LBK in Central Europe in the second half of 6th millennium BC, together with different, in comparison with local HG groups, economy and material culture, is being interpreted as an evidence of migratory character of this movement [10]. Based on archaeological data it has been suggested that LBK populations either replaced the pre-existing HG populations or, alternatively, coexisted with them utilizing different resources and areas [11,12]. However some degree of contact between sites representing both the LBK and HG context is observed in form of exchange of goods such as lithic resources [13]. The LBK presence in Central Europe lasted for around four hundred years, and throughout this period it remained seemingly unchanged maintaining its economic, cultural and social character [14]. In the first half of 5th millennium BC this homogenous culture differentiated into several distinctive cultures belonging to late Danubian sequence (LDN in our paper). Those new cultural entities include: Grossgartach, R\u00f6ssen, Stroke-ornamented ware culture (StBK), Late Band Pottery Culture (LBPC), Malice, and Lengyel cultures, and are found in more diverse set of ecological zones compared to the LBK [15]. They also display a changing socioeconomic organization of their communities [14]. In some regions, notably in the northern part of former LBK occupation, large stable settlements were replaced by small and short-lived sites with late Danubian archaeological assemblages, located on sandy-soils occupied earlier by local HG. The post-LBK period\u2014the first 400\u2013500 years after the end of the LBK\u2014in all the main regions of the Polish lowlands marked a complete disintegration of the preceding LBK arrangements and the discontinuous development of new forms of spatial organization. The changes are thought by archaeologists, to originate from internal social dynamics of those communities, although they allowed for more extensive contacts with HG groups in later period [15]. The second half of 5th millennium BC marks the emergence of the final groups belonging to the Danubian Neolithic, with the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Group being the prominent example in the Polish lowlands. Archaeologists see these final stages of Linear Pottery cultures as a synthesis of various elements, including those of local HG both in terms of economy and material culture [16]. The end of Danubian sequence is marked by another widespread phenomenon known as the Funnel Beaker Culture (TRB, from Trichterbecherkultur). This new entity emerged almost simultaneously along Baltic Coast and in the Kuyavia region in the end of the 5th millennium BC. The TRB is sometimes called Northern Europe\u2019s first autochthonous farming population [17]; however the idea is being disputed as early TRB exhibits very few Mesolithic elements in their archaeological record. Moreover, since it was partially contemporaneous with the LDN sequence, the emergence of the TRB as a result of divergence of linear cultures, strengthened by different interregional contacts, cannot be excluded [13].",
            "Geneticists have been trying to directly address questions related to the origins and spread of Neolithic populations in Central Europe. The investigation of hypervariable region (HVR) of mitochondrial (mt) DNA from LBK individuals from present-day Germany, Austria and Hungary [18,19], led researchers to propose the N1a, later supplemented by T2, J, K, V and HV [19,20] as a \u2018signature haplogroups\u2019 of the LBK, as they were found in relatively high frequencies in early farmers in comparison to HG and modern European populations. By contrast haplogroups U2, U4, U5 and U8 have been found to dominate in European HG populations [21\u201325] differentiating them from LBK communities. Further data from LBK populations, (including ALP) and their predecessors Star\u010devo and K\u00f6r\u00f6s cultures, show similar haplogroup patterns to that reported for the LBK alone, pointing to genetic uniformity of linear cultures and lack of HG genetic involvement in their formation [5,26].",
            "The genomic data supported the idea about lack of genetic continuity between the LBK and the local Hunter - Gathers [5,27,28]. However, the LDN populations such as the R\u00f6ssen culture have received less attention and are often merged and/or analyzed together with data from individuals from LBK contexts [29]. The contacts between Danubian and HG communities that led to gradual change of their economy and material culture seen by archaeologists seem to have no impact on the genetic composition of both communities. However, sparse occurrences of typical HG haplogroups found in late Danubian populations [30,31], indicate that some degree of genetic influx occurred between those populations. The samples coming from the TRB complex also were the focus of the researches, who found out that they genetically differed slightly from LBK individuals [20,22], with whole genome data showing higher HG component in the TRB [6].",
            "The main aim of our study was to analyze genetic affinities of LDN populations looking for potential genomic influx from HGs. We generated complete mt genomes from individuals belonging to LBK and late Danubian contexts excavated in modern-day Poland and combined these data with available partial and complete ancient European mt genomes to investigate haplogroup differences between LBK, its successors from the LDN sequence, Central European Hunter-Gatherers and other post-Danubian populations.",
            "Twenty-five individuals were selected for our study of mt genomes. The individuals had been excavated in either a LBK context (n=\u20097) or various LDN contexts, including Lengyel culture (n=\u200912), Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Group (BKG;n=\u20094) and Malice Culture (MC;n=\u20091). Additionally, one Mesolithic individual from Janis\u0142awice in central Poland was included. Detailed archaeological information for all the individuals can be found in supplementary material (Additional file1: Supplementary Text S1 and Additional file2: Table S1).",
            "For comparative population analyses, we used either published mt haplogroup frequencies (n=\u2009992) or, where available, complete mitochondrial genomes retrieved from web depositorieshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena; (n=\u2009192). For analyses based on haplogroup frequencies, we grouped available data following [32] with minor modifications (Additional file2: Table S2). We merged all LDN mt haplogroup data and excluded HG data predating last glacial maximum following results by [33] to better represent the local genetic makeup at the time of arrival of the first farmers. We also added Near Eastern Neolithic groups based on recently published data [27,34].",
            "The complete mitochondrial genomes were divided into eight distinct groups, including Hunter-Gatherers (HG), Near Eastern Neolithic (NEN), Yamnaya and major central European Neolithic cultures where all data for populations associated with the Funnel Beaker Culture were merged into one group (TRB) (Additional file2: Table S3).

            "All necessary precautions against DNA contamination were used during the collection of samples and extraction of aDNA. From each individual either teeth or fragments of cortical bone from long bones were collected and analyzed.",
            "Extraction of aDNA was conducted in the laboratory designed for aDNA analysis at the Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144. The laboratory is equipped with positive air pressure, HEPA filters, flow hoods and automatic UVC lamp system. Before DNA extraction, teeth and bone fragments were cleaned with 5% NaOCl and rinsed three times with sterile water followed by UV irradiation for at least two hours per each side. After UV exposure, the samples were drilled using Dremel\u00ae drill bits and ~250\u00a0mg of teeth/bone powder was collected to sterile screw cap tubes (2\u00a0ml). The inner part of teeth roots and cortical bone of long bones were targeted. Total DNA was extracted from the powder using a silica-based method [35] modified as in [36].",
            "Twenty microliters of DNA extract were converted into blunt-end Illumina genomic library, following [37], omitting the initial nebulization step due to fragmentation of a DNA. Genomic libraries were amplified by setting up 6 individual PCR reactions for each library as in [38]. All six PCR reactions per library were pooled and purified with AMPure\u00ae XP Reagents (Agencourt-Beckman Coulter) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The concentrations of the libraries and DNA fragment length distributions were calculated using High Sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape assay on 2200 TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies). Prior to sequencing, up to12 indexed DNA libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and sequenced together. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 run in 125 pair-end mode at the SNP & SEQ technology platform in Uppsala, Sweden.",
            "The DNA libraries that yielded insufficient mitochondrial genome coverage (<9 X) through the initial Illumina screening and generated more than 25 mitochondrial reads were enriched for mtDNA sequences, amplified and sequenced as in [31]. This was done by using an in-solution hybridization capture method and commercially biotinylated DNA-capture MYbaits\u00ae probes (MYcroarray\u00ae) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Two rounds of capture were performed for each sample [39]. Fusion primers PISI and AIS4 [31] were used for the second round of post-capture amplification, enabling sequencing of blunt-end Illumina libraries on Ion Torrent PGM system (Life Technologies). The sequencing was performed at the Molecular Biology Techniques Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
            "To process Illumina\u2019s HiSeq2500 shotgun sequencing data, we followed the procedure described in [38]. MergeReadsFastQ_cc.py [37] script was used to remove adapters and merge read pairs, requiring an overlap of at least 11\u00a0bp and summing up base qualities. Merged reads were mapped as single-end reads against the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) using BWA aln version 0.7.8 [40] with the non-default parameters -l 16500 -n 0.01 -o 2 -t 2. The molecular sex of the analyzed individuals was assigned based on the ratio of reads (with mapping quality greater than 30) mapping to Y and X chromosomes (Ry) [41].",
            "Ion Torrent PGM data from the mtDNA capture was processed as follows. The scripts fastx_barcode_splitter.pl and fastx_trimmer (from the FASTX toolkit) were used to demultiplex the reads by barcode, using a one mismatch threshold. Cutadapt v1.8.1 software [42] was then used to trim adapters using the following parameters\u2009\u2212\u2009e 0.3333, \u2212m 35, \u2212M 110\u2009\u2212\u2009q 20, \u2212n 5. The filtered reads were checked with FastQC v 0.11.3 [43] before being mapped against the rCRS using TMAP v3.4.1 [44] with the options: \u2212g 3 -M 3 -n 7 -v stage1 \u2013stage-keep-all map1 \u2013seed-length 12 \u2013seed-max-diff 4 stage2 map2 \u2013z-best 5 map3 \u2013max-seed-hits 10. FilterUniqueSAMCons.py [37] was used to collapse PCR duplicate reads with identical start and end coordinates, for both Illumina and PGM data.",
            "All Illumina and PGM data for each sample were then merged using samtools merge option [45]. Misincorporation patterns and fragment length distribution were analyzed using mapDamage v2.0.5 [46]. Additionally we used Schmutzi software [47] with default settings to estimate present-day human contamination levels by scanning a database of modern human putative contamination sources.",
            "The Biomatters IGV software v2.3.66 [48] was used to visualize the sequence assembly. Finally, consensus sequences were built using the program ANGSD v0.910 [49] and only reads with minimum base quality of 20, mapping score of 30 and a minimum coverage of 3x were used. Previously published mt genomes were reconstructed from BAM files acquired from published data using the same pipeline as described above.",
            "Mitochondrial haplotypes were determined based on the PhyloTree phylogenetic tree [50] build 17 and by using the HAPLOFIND web application [51]. The mutations reported as missing or unexpected were visually inspected in IGV to check if they could be results of misincorporations in low coverage regions. In one case, the sample from Janis\u0142awice (Jan1), the coverage was insufficient for reliable consensus sequence assignment. Here, the BAM file was inspected visually in order to detect SNPs and only SNPs that were supported by reads with a total coverage of 3x and containing reads from both forward and reverse strands were reported.",

After testing several configurations with k\u2009=\u2009{4, 5,\u2026, 9}, the best clustering for our dataset according to Davies Bouldin Index [52] was obtained using Squared Euclidean distance, with k\u2009=\u20096. The k-means clustering was performed in RapidMiner Studio 7.",
            "Pairwise genetic distances were computed in the Arlequin 3.5 software [53] using the complete mitochondrial genomes of the ancient individuals. To reduce the chance of incorporating erroneous SNPs, we have trimmed the first and last 30 nucleotides from all of the consensus mtDNA sequences, because these regions were ambiguously sequenced in some reference data. We computed Nei\u2019s average number of pairwise differences between the populations [54] with 1000 permutations and p-value of 0.05 and used its linearized form [55].",
            "Standard version of analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [53] was used to calculate the proportion of genetic variance between and within the defined groups. In the Arlequin 3.5 package, the AMOVA was computed from the pairwise FSTmatrix (10 000 permutations). This test was primarily used to infer the affiliation of populations into broader defined clusters of populations. AMOVA was used to assess the likelihood that any of the other cultures was a continuous population with LDN, a total of 8 population structures were tested. LDN was grouped consecutively with one from the other 7 populations (HG, LBK, TRB, NEN, CWC, BBC, YAM) while remaining 6 populations were kept separately (Additional file2: Table S6).",

To reduce possible bias and noise in the data, we have removed all polymorphic positions with unknown SNPs (\u201cNs\u201d). Following [57,58], the network construction procedure included weighting the most common mutations inversely according to their frequency. The batches of most frequent polymorphisms were assigned reduced weights using in-house script (deposited athttps://github.com/EdaEhler/bioutils_python) in the following manner: the most frequent polymorphism (or group of polymorphisms) was given the weight of 1, the second most common polymorphism was given the weight of 2, the third most common polymorphism was given the weight of 3, etc. up to 10. All remaining polymorphic loci retained the default weight of 10. Computations consisted of using Reduced Median algorithm [57] followed by Median Joining algorithm [58] and maximum parsimony calculation (postprocessing) to reduce the superfluous links [59].",

From the remaining samples, 8 more libraries that produced at least 25 mitochondrial fragments were selected for the mtDNA enrichment process. The average mitochondrial genome coverage after capture varied between 2 and 113 and therefore we could determine the haplogroups for 4 more of the samples.

This stands in contradiction to suggestions that late Danubian populations should be in closest genetic relation to the LBK, the notion previously suggested by both archaeologists [2] and geneticists [20]. Our results also contradicts the hypothesis, that TRB groups belonged to a different tradition than the Danubian sequence, and that they had other, possibly local Mesolithic, origins [17,60]. Instead our data support the idea that through their long presence in Central Europe, the Danubian populations gradually differentiated from groups associated with the LBK culture into a sequence of populations belonging to various LDN populations, and that some of those populations in turn were driving the emergence of the TRB [13].",
            "The majority of the haplotypes from LDN populations, acquired by us and in other studies, are considered to be typical for the LBK. However, several of them belong to U5b and U5a haplogroup [30,31,61] which is thought to be a part of HG component of the European gene pool. The relatively similar frequency of U5b haplogroup, found in populations belonging to both the LDN and the TRB complex seems to be responsible for drawing them closer together in our analyses. The haplogroups U5b and U5a are considered to belong to Hunter-Gatherer component of European gene-pool [20]. The origin of U5b in TRB populations from modern-day Germany is being interpreted as an increase in Hunter-Gatherer mt lineages in middle Neolithic [20], a view supported by whole genome data [32]. Likewise, based on whole genomic data, some genetic admixture from Scandinavian HG to northern TRB populations was observed [6].",
            "Neither PCA nor MDS can directly answer where U5 individuals, differentiating LDN and TRB from LBK, came from, and what was the direction and nature of the gene flow. The Hunter - Gatherers of Central Europe, based on well documented history of contacts between them and LDN communities, seem to be most probable candidate for source of U5 haplotypes. On the other hand, HG populations are also frequently documented to live close to farming communities but maintaining their genetic distance [23]. One can also argue that TRB populations lived in close proximity with late Danubian communities (in particular the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Group [62] and therefore the possibility of a gene flow from the TRB to the LDN should also be taken into consideration.",
            "However, the network analysis shows that both LDN and TRB U5b haplogroups originated from haplotypes found in HG individuals, so the direct gene flow between LDN and TRB groups, based on few available samples, is not supported. Notably, in case of U5b part of the median network all basal (i.e. close to the center of the network) haplotypes belong to Central Europe HG while the haplotypes found in LDN, TRB, LBK, BBC and CWC samples form the outer part of the network, which suggests that they constitute a derived version of haplotypes, with more accumulated substitutions compared to the U5b haplogroups from HG.",
            "Assuming that HG groups were the source of U5 haplotypes in LDN populations it would be interesting to speculate on exact source and nature of this gene flow. The fact that out of four U5 individuals found in LDN populations 3 belong to U5b while one belongs to U5a haplogroup [61]. One possible explanation of this disproportion is the low sample size and the U5a might simply have been missed by our sample. However, what is noteworthy\u00a0the majority of Mesolithic individuals with U5a haplotypes come from outside of Central Europe, most notably from Scandinavia [6,22]. That stands in contrast with the fact that a majority of cultural exchange, between the LDN and HG, is seen between the LDN and northern HG groups (notably Erteb\u00f8lle culture) and not neighboring lowlands groups (such as Janis\u0142awice culture) [15]. Meantime, HG elements seen in the TRB material culture came from various HG backgrounds, both from Baltic see coast, and European lowlands [13]. However, the cultural diversity of European Hunter - Gatherers does not seem to be reflected by their genetic diversity [33], as they seem to be rather uniform group and therefore differentiating between potential sources of genetic influx to either the LDN or the TRB might be difficult.",
            "The two new U5b haplotypes, recovered in this and our previous study [31], come from two geographically and chronologically distant sites. U5b2a1a was found in KZ1 female from the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski group of Lengyel Culture. It is dated to 4226\u2009\u00b1\u200974\u00a0cal. BC, and comes from Krusza Zamkowa site, which is known for its rich burials with numerous imports [63], some stylistically resembling HG artifacts. U5b1b found in the KM1 female excavated in Kazimierza Ma\u0142a site belonged to the Malice Culture dated to around 4800\u20134500 BC. The Malice Culture itself exhibits influences from other linear pottery groups mostly from the Lengyel and Polg\u00e1r cultures south from it [64]. Elements of Hunter-Gatherer origin are not proposed for the Malice Culture itself; however close ties and its possible involvement in formation of the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski group are debated [65].",
            "Our data, from this and the previous study [31], shows that in its long existence the LBK gradually changed into the LDN not only in terms of material culture but also in terms of its genetic composition. The change observed by us in form of introduction of U5b haplotypes is most probably the result of gene flow from HG populations. This idea, proposed also for populations from western fringe of LDN populations [30], pushes back in time the resurgence of HG maternal lineages seen by others in TRB populations [20]. The nature of this flow might be, to some extent, explained by what we know about social and migration behaviors of Danubians. Both isotopic and genetic data have given us some clues about the social organization of early farming communities. Strontium isotope data suggest greater mobility of women than men in some LBK populations [66,67], which may indicate patrilocal model of society. The genetic data also points towards patrilocality in Early Neolithic as a most probable cause of differences in mtDNA and Y-chromosome composition of European gene pool [68]. This hypothesis is also strengthened by much higher haplogroup diversity of mtDNA than Y-chromosome DNA observed in the LBK population from Hungary [26]. Similar higher diversity of maternal compared to paternal lineages was found in Neolithic populations that emerged along Mediterranean route of neolithisation [69,70]. Those results may explain the nature of influx of foreign mitochondrial haplogroups into early farming communities. It seems possible that to some extent it was customary to introduce females from neighboring communities into LBK and LDN groups, with different Hunter-Gatherer groups being the most probable source of this influx. However, to determine that more, both genetic and isotopic data is needed from those populations.",
            "We acquired 5 new complete mitochondrial genomes from Late Danubian populations from modern day Poland. Population genetic analyses run on our data combined with published haplotypes show that Late Danubian populations are maternally closer related to TRB groups instead of culturally similar LBK. We assume that U5 haplotypes found by us and other researchers in those populations are responsible for this affinity. Since U5 is thought to be one of haplogroups characteristic for HG component of European gene pool, we argue that its presence points to gene flow from HG to both Late Danubian and TRB populations.",

            "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a major cause of blindness and results from irreversible retinal ganglion cell damage and optic nerve degeneration. In the United States, POAG is most prevalent in African-Americans. Mitochondrial genetics and dysfunction have been implicated in POAG, and potentially pathogenic sequence variations, in particular novel transversional base substitutions, are reportedly common in mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) from POAG patient blood. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the spectrum of sequence variation in mtDNA from African-American POAG patients and determine whether novel nonsynonymous, transversional or other potentially pathogenic sequence variations are observed more commonly in POAG cases than controls. mtDNA from African-American POAG cases (n = 22) and age-matched controls (n = 22) was analyzed by deep sequencing of a single 16,487 base pair PCR amplicon by Ion Torrent, and candidate novel variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Sequence variants were classified and interpreted using the MITOMAP compendium of polymorphisms. 99.8% of the observed variations had been previously reported. The ratio of novel variants to POAG cases was 7-fold lower than a prior estimate. Novel mtDNA variants were present in 3 of 22 cases, novel nonsynonymous changes in 1 of 22 cases and novel transversions in 0 of 22 cases; these proportions are significantly lower (p<.0005, p<.0004, p<.0001) than estimated previously for POAG, and did not differ significantly from controls. Although it is possible that mitochondrial genetics play a role in African-Americans\u2019 high susceptibility to POAG, it is unlikely that any mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction is due to an abnormally high incidence of novel mutations that can be detected in mtDNA from peripheral blood.",
            "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is defined as a spectrum of diseases causing vision loss as a result of progressive and irreversible retinal ganglion cell damage, optic nerve degeneration and corresponding visual field loss [1]. African-Americans are disproportionately affected by POAG. A metaanalysis of 46 observational studies found that POAG prevalence in people over age 70 was 16% for blacks and 6% for whites [2], and the age-adjusted prevalence rate of POAG in African-Americans is four- to five-fold higher than whites [3].",
            "Mitochondria are subcellular organelles descended from an ancient bacterial endosymbiont. They are responsible for energy metabolism based on oxidative phosphorylation, and play a central role in apoptosis and tissue homeostasis. Although supported and regulated by ~1,500 nuclear genes, human mitochondria possess their own genome, mtDNA, a circular molecule of 16,549 base pairs encoding 22 tRNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs and protein components of the electron transfer chain. mtDNA variants and haplogroups have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [4]. Mutations in mtDNA may result in degeneration of the optic nerve: a nonsynonymous mitochondrial mutation was first identified as the cause of Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) [5]. Inheritance of human mtDNA is exclusively maternal, and all humans can trace their maternal ancestry back to a single African woman, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA), who lived 194,300 +/- 32,550 years ago [6]. Sequence variants in mtDNA have accumulated in a manner proportional to divergence time, giving rise to distinct collections of ancestral variants, \u201chaplogroups\u201d, that reflect humanity\u2019s African genesis and patterns of global migration. African mitochondrial haplogroups have been linked to elevated risk for POAG in Saudi patients [7].",
            "Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial genetics and function might play a role in POAG pathogenesis [8]. For example, a maternal family history of POAG is more likely than a paternal one, as would be expected from mitochondrial genetics: mothers and sisters of glaucoma patients were more likely to have glaucoma than fathers and brothers [9]. The loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) is characteristic of POAG, and RGC have a high energy requirement, which may make them especially vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction. A mitochondrial complex-I defect has been proposed as a mechanism for the loss of trabecular meshwork cells in POAG, which were found to have higher levels of reactive oxygen species and to be more sensitive to mitochondrial inhibition than normal cells; treatment with antioxidants or mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitors might inhibit disease progression [10]. Lymphocytes of POAG patients were reported to have significantly lower mean mitochondrial respiratory activity, and POAG lymphoblast cell lines were recently found to have a complex-I ATP synthesis defect [11-13]. Finally, 52% of Saudi POAG cases were found to harbor novel potentially pathogenic nonsynonymous changes in mtDNA from blood and 63% of POAG cases were found to have novel and unusual transversional (purine <-> pyrimidine) nucleotide substitutions [11]. It was hypothesized that somatic mtDNA transversions were generated in response to oxidative stress in early development or throughout life, contributing to optic nerve injury in POAG.",
            "The mitochondrial mutations implicated in LHON have been examined in POAG patients, but do not appear to be significant risk factors, although one study of Japanese patients found 5 LHON-associated mitochondrial mutations in 551 cases, vs. none in 284 controls [14]. One investigation failed to find an association between mtDNA haplotypes and POAG [15], but included only subjects from European populations. A study of 176 Saudi POAG patients and 186 controls found that individuals with African mtDNA haplotypes were at higher risk for developing glaucoma, whereas a Eurasian mtDNA haplogroup may have a mild protective effect [7]. However, a study of Ghanaian patients concluded that mtDNA haplogroups did not confer susceptibility to POAG [16].",
            "Mitochondrial sequence variation in POAG has not been examined in an African-American population. The objective of this study was to determine the numbers and types of previously described mtDNA polymorphisms and measure the prevalence of novel variants. A main goal was to replicate the finding that a majority of POAG patients harbor novel and potentially pathogenic variants in mtDNA, in particular transversional base substitutions [11]. This observation has been cited as evidence for mitochondrial involvement in glaucoma and could explain the systemic respiratory defects observed in cells from POAG patients, and possibly the high prevalence of POAG in African-Americans. If commonly detectable in peripheral blood, such variation could have translational utility. For example, inherited or acquired mitochondrial dysfunction in POAG may be treatable with dietary interventions [17].",
            "This research was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki under a protocol approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania. All subjects provided informed written consent to participate in this study.",
            "Subjects for deep mitochondrial sequencing were randomly selected from those recruited for the Primary Open-angle African-American Glaucoma Genetics (POAAGG) study within the clinical practices of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Clinical research coordinators screened potential subjects based on institutional review board-approved inclusion/exclusion criteria. All POAAGG subjects must self-identify as Black (African-American, African descent, African Caribbean) and be age 35 or older. Subjects who met these criteria provided informed written consent, following a physician\u2019s review of the subject\u2019s medical record. Subjects were placed into two phenotypic categories: case or control. Case subjects were defined as those diagnosed with primary/chronic open-angle glaucoma, who had no prior diagnosis or history of ocular inflammations (e.g. uveitis), high myopia (-8 diopters or greater), other forms of glaucoma (e.g., traumatic, pseudoexfoliation, narrow/closed angle and neovascular), optic-nerve neuropathy, optic-nerve drusen and vein/artery occlusion of the retina. None of the cases had normal tension glaucoma. To ensure phenotypic rigor, POAG was defined as the presence of an open angle with both criteria employed by the LALES study [18]: \"(1) congruent, characteristic or compatible glaucomatous visual \ufb01eld (VF) abnormality and (2) evidence of characteristic or compatible glaucomatous optic disc damage in at least one eye. Case subjects were graded based on clinical ophthalmic examination and were required to have:",

            "characteristic visual field defects defined by at least one of the following on two consecutive visual fields in at least one eye and consistent with optic nerve evaluation: a) glaucoma hemi field test result of outside normal limits; and b) pattern standard deviation triggered at 5% or worse.\"",
            "Exclusion criteria for POAAGG controls were: a history of any form of glaucoma, vein/artery occlusion of the retina, high myopia, ocular inflammation, optic nerve neuropathy or a significant visual field loss associated with ocular disease (e.g. proliferative diabetic retinopathy). The following ocular comorbidities were documented for all subjects and did not prohibit enrollment as defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria: macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, pseudophakia and posterior vitreous detachment.",
            "A detailed ocular examination was performed on all subjects, and phenotypic data for the following variables were collected: intra-ocular pressure (at enrollment and maximum), central corneal thickness, cup to disc ratio and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Intra-ocular pressure was obtained by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), and where a reliable GAT was not possible, a portable tonometer was utilized. An ultrasonic pachymeter was used to obtain central corneal thickness. The estimated cup to disc ratio was determined by the clinician\u2019s observation of the optic nerve during a dilated fundus examination. RNFL was measured by ocular coherence tomography (OCT). The subject\u2019s medical record was reviewed for data on additional variables: current or previous treatment with ocular medication, current or previous ocular surgery and a family history of glaucoma. All available ocular imaging reports from OCT, Heidelberg retinal tomography, visual field and fundus photography were reviewed for each subject.",

Thermal cycling was done on a BioRad iCyler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) as follows: 94 deg 2 min; 32 cycles (94 deg 10 sec, 71 deg 30 sec, 68 deg 24.5 min with increase of 20 sec per cycle); 72 deg 5 min; hold 10 deg. The presence of a single band was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide, and its identity was verified by bidirectional Sanger sequencing.",

Ion Torrent sequencing libraries were constructed using Ion Xpress fragment library kits with enzymatic shearing and the Ion Xpress bar-code adapters 1-16 kit. A Pippin Prep instrument (Sage Science, Beverly, MA) was used for size selection during library construction. DNA concentrations were quantified and size distributions evaluated with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Emulsion PCR and enrichment were done with Xpress Template kit v2.0 and Ion OneTouch-ES instrument. A QuBit 2.0 fluorometer was used for quality control and to quantify Ion sphere particle enrichment.

To reduce the likelihood of false positives, candidate variants with mixed base calls below a filtering threshold of 25% were excluded from further analysis. Variants not confirmed by reanalysis with v2.2 of VariantCaller, by resequencing the same library a second time on Ion Torrent or by CE, Sanger sequencing were also excluded. The Integrated Genomics Viewer [21] (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) was used to view the alignment of individual reads.

Ion Torrent overall sequencing accuracy on mtDNA was estimated from the number of concordant calls between Sanger and Ion Torrent sequencing. False negative variants were defined as those that were detected by Sanger sequencing, but not by Ion Torrent, and false positive variants as those reported by Ion Torrent, but subsequently invalidated by Sanger. The \"false negative variant rate\" was defined as S/(S+B), and the \"false positive variant rate\" as I/(I+B), where S = variants detected by Sanger, but not Ion Torrent (false negatives), and B = variants detected by both methods (true positives) and I = variants detected by Ion Torrent, but not Sanger (false positives). S, B and I were calculated individually for transitions ((purine <-> purine: A<->G) or (pyrimidine <-> pyrimidine: C<->T)), transversions (purine <-> pyrimidine: A<->C, A<->T, G<->C, G<->T) and insertions plus deletions.

Accordingly, Ion Torrent sequencing accuracy was estimated to be >99.9%. More than 86% of the Ion Torrent errors were false negatives involving failure to call small insertions and deletions.

Accordingly, the proportion of African-Americans with novel mtDNA variants was 9.1% (95% confidence interval: 3% to 22%), with novel variants observed in 13.6% of POAG cases (95% confidence interval: 4% to 34%), and 4.5% of controls (95% confidence interval: <0.01% to 24%). The difference in number of POAG cases (1) with novel variants from controls (3) with novel variants is not statistically significant. All three novel variants in POAG cases were transitions (Table3). The first, m.8274C>T, occurs in a non-coding region and has been observed in other primates (tarsier and bush baby, source: UCSC human genome browser [26] conservation track [27]) and is therefore unlikely to be pathogenic. The second, m.11813C>T, causes a Leu>Phe amino acid replacement at an imperfectly conserved residue in the ND4 gene, and was predicted to be \"benign\" by PolyPhen-2. The third, m.12266A>G, is located within the 5'-acceptor end of the MT-TL2 tRNA leucine gene. This A>G transition has been observed in another primate and other organisms according to the Mamit-tRNA database [28] (http://mamit-tRNA.u-strasbg.fr), so is also unlikely to be pathogenic.",
            "For the population as a whole (n = 44) the proportion with novel transversions was 2.3% (95% confidence interval: <0.01% to 13%). No POAG cases were found to harbor a novel transversion (purine <-> pyrimidine substitution) in mtDNA (95% confidence interval: 0% to 18%), but one instance of a novel transversion, m.10694A>T, was observed in a control (95% confidence interval: <0.01% to 24%) (Table3). This substitution, within the coding region of the ND4L gene, is synonymous and presumably benign. The difference between cases and controls with novel transversions was not significant (p = 1.00, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed). No novel insertions or deletions were found (Table2). Instances of previously reported insertions and deletions were detected, but did not differ significantly between cases and controls (p = 0.75, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed). Six apparently heteroplasmic variants were identified (m.310T>C, m.1999A>G, m.13581T>C, m.16150C>T, m.16390G>A, m.16399A>G), four in cases and two in controls. These were identified on the basis of mixed Ion Torrent reads, with variant frequencies ranging from 25% to 60%, and the heteroplasmy was confirmed by CE, Sanger sequencing (Figure3). The difference between POAG cases having heteroplasmic variants vs. controls was not statistically significant, and these variants have all been reported previously.",

            "Polymorphisms were classified as \"disease-associated\" if annotated as such by MITOMAP and at least one publication has proposed a linkage to disease. A total of 171 instances of disease-associated variants of 31 different types were detected, 84 in POAG cases and 87 in controls, and 0% were transversions (Table4). On average, 3.8 instances of disease-associated variation were found per POAG case, vs. 4.0 per control. Variant m.16189T>C, linked to multiple diseases, was observed twice as often in controls as in cases; however this difference is not statistically significant. The differences in frequency between cases and controls for the 30 other disease-associated nucleotide changes also did not differ significantly (Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed).",
            "Phylogenetic analysis with MITOMASTER placed the study participants\u2019 mtDNA into eight major macrohaplogroups (L0, L1, L2, L3, M, J, H, U). 86% of the study population was categorized as having African mitochondrial ancestry (haplogroups L0, L1, L2, L3), 11% as having European ancestry (haplogroups J, H, U) and 2% (one person) as having Asian ancestry (haplogroup M). Twice as many cases (8) as controls (4) were found in haplogroup L2, but this difference is not significant (p = 0.31, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed).Figure4depicts the phylogenetic relationship among this study\u2019s 44 mtDNAs. African haplogroups L1, L2, and L3 predominate, accounting for 20%, 27% and 34% of the study population, respectively. The divergence times between the L0, L1, L2 and L3 African lineages are ancient relative to the European ones, which are all more recently derived from the mtDNA lineage leading to L3.",

            "A 2006 study [11] reported 34 different novel mtDNA variants in 27 POAG cases, 8 of which are now present in MITOMAP, leaving 26 of these variants as currently novel. Using the same criterion, absence from MITOMAP, to define novelty, the present study found only three novel variants (Table3) in 22 African-American POAG cases, a proportion that is lower by seven-fold than the 2006 study and did not differ significantly from controls. The 2006 study reported novel nonsynonymous variants classified as \"pathogenic\" in 52% (14 of 27) POAG cases, whereas this study identified novel nonsynonymous variants in less than 5% (1 of 22) POAG cases. This difference is highly significant (p<.0004, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed); furthermore, the sole novel nonsynonymous variant detected in an African-American POAG case (Table3) was not predicted to be pathogenic. Accordingly, this evidence does not support the proposition that novel nonsynonymous or pathogenic variants are found commonly in mtDNA from POAG blood.",
            "Vertebrate mitochondrial genomes are characterized by rapid molecular evolution relative to nuclear genes and an extreme bias favoring transitional base substitutions relative to transversional substitutions. This bias varies little among the mitochondria of humans and great apes [29]. It is therefore unexpected that the 2006 study identified novel transversions in mtDNA of 17 of 27 (63%) of Saudi POAG cases, with a high ratio of transversions to transitions. The present study\u2019s finding that 0 of 22 African-American POAG cases harbored a novel mitochondrial transversion is significantly lower (p<0.0001, Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed) and does not support the theory that novel mtDNA transversions are characteristic of POAG, or that alternative DNA damage and repair mechanisms are involved in the generation of mtDNA mutations in POAG patients.",
            "Random sequencing errors are more likely to generate candidate mtDNA variants that appear to be: 1)novel(because the number of reported polymorphisms is small relative to the number of possible substitutions in mtDNA), 2)nonsynonymous(because most possible mtDNA substitutions correspond to open reading frames and alter coding) or 3)transversions(because a 2:1 ratio of transversions to transitions is expected from chance). No novel nonsynonymous transversions were detected in 44 samples. The overall concordance between Sanger and Ion Torrent sequencing was >99.9%, so is unlikely that the number of novel transversions in mtDNA of POAG cases was underestimated substantially. However, Sanger sequencing confirmed that both false negative and false positive errors were present in the Ion Torrent data. The large majority of errors were false negatives on true small insertions or deletions located at homopolymer tracts, e.g., a run of 7 C nucleotides at rCRS positions 303-309. The false negative variant rate was 0% for transversions, vs. 0.2% for transitions and the false positive variant rate was 11.8% for transversions vs. 1.0% for transitions. Accordingly, the number of transversions was more likely to be overestimated than underestimated. Another possible source of error in PCR-based mtDNA sequencing is off-target amplification of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial pseudogenes. This possibility was minimized by using long (>30 base pair) PCR primers and a single very large (16,487 base pair) amplicon for PCR enrichment. No evidence was found for significant amplification of nuclear DNA, based on absence of secondary bands on DNA gels and results from aligning Ion Torrent reads to the complete human genome reference sequence, hg19 (data not shown).",
            "A limitation of this study was that an 82 base pair region of the D-loop, corresponding to rCRS positions 1-9 and 16,497-16,569, was outside the single PCR amplicon, i.e., 0.5% of each genome was not amplified, and any variants in this region were not detected. Candidate variants called with frequencies <25% were excluded from the analysis to reduce the likelihood of false positives, so if true low-level heteroplasmic variants were present, these are likely to have been missed as well. We did not attempt to characterize the Ion Torrent PGM\u2019s sensitivity to low-level mitochondrial heteroplasmy; however, our results suggest it is likely to be position-specific and dependent on factors such as read depth, sequence context and type of genetic alteration. Consistent with a recent study [30], we found the Ion Torrent\u2019s error rate on insertions and deletions was much higher than for substitutions. The practice of equating variant \"novelty\" with non-registration in MITOMAP has been criticized on the basis that other approaches, such as Google searching, may be more sensitive to identifying previously observed variants [31]. Accordingly, using a more stringent criterion to define \"novelty\" may result in estimates for the proportion of POAG patients and controls harboring a novel variant that are even lower than the 9.1% reported here.",
            "The functional significance, if any, of the individual novel, previously reported and disease-associated variants for POAG for African-Americans was outside the scope of this study, but deserves further investigation. This study lacked the statistical power needed to detect effects of individual sequence variants; the large majority of variants were rare, only observed once in cases or controls. The 31 disease-associated variants (Table4) are a subset of polymorphisms for which a linkage to a disease has been proposed in one or more publications. However, distinguishing mildly pathogenic mitochondrial mutations from benign variants is challenging, with interpretation subject to controversy. A particular mtDNA variant may be both deleterious and beneficial depending on its haplogroup and environmental context [32]. For example, a European haplogroup J background has been shown to increase the penetrance of primary LHON mutations and to sensitize cells to environmental insults, such as exposure to hexane [33].",
            "The great diversity in mtDNA ancestral haplogroups present in African-Americans adds further complexity to interpreting sequence variation. Although this study only examined 44 people, the deepest roots of human ancestry are represented (Figure4). At least 20% of the study population was assigned to each of the African haplogroups L1, L2 and L3. These three are estimated to have diverged approximately 142,300 +/-38,200 years ago [6]. Accordingly, future studies of mitochondrial variation in African-Americans and its possible relationship to POAG might be stratified to ensure that the major haplogroups have balanced representation in cases and controls, so as not to confound ancient and recent variation.",
            "A larger total number of variants was observed in cases (1,146) than in controls (1,020) (Table2). This likely reflects differences in the ancestral composition of the two groups, in conjuction with the use of the rCRS, a European haplogroup H mtDNA, as the reference sequence. If, for example, the African-American POAG patients had been compared to a hypothetical control group with exclusively European maternal ancestry, one would expect to observe fewer variants in that control group, on account of its recent common ancestry with the rCRS. The control group for this study was indeed found to contain fewer L1 and L2 mtDNAs, which are distantly related to the rCRS (Figure4). So the direction of systematic bias from imperfectly balanced ancestry plus use of the European rCRS to identify \"variants\" was to favor variant identification in the POAG group over controls. Such a bias might be controlled for in future studies by scoring variation relative to a derived common ancestral sequence, such as the Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence [34], which incoporates recent data from Neanderthal mtDNAs.",
            "African-American POAG cases closely resembled controls with respect to frequency and types of sequence variation in mtDNA, with very similar numbers of novel variants, heteroplasmic variants, transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions and disease-associated polymorphisms. This work did not directly address the issue of whether mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to POAG pathogenesis. However it does suggest that if mitochondrial functional defects are found in African-American POAG patients, as in other populations, these defects are unlikely to be explained or diagnosed by an unusual mutational spectrum in mtDNA that is detectable in peripheral blood. Future studies will require larger cohorts and could consider ancestral haplogroups, somatic mtDNA variation within the eye, variation in nuclear mitochondrial genes and environmental exposures that may impair mitochondrial function.",

            "African history has been significantly influenced by the Sahara, which has represented a barrier for migrations of all living beings, including humans. Major exceptions were the gene flow events that took place between North African and sub-Saharan populations during the so-called African Humid Periods, especially in the Early Holocene (11.5 to 5.5 thousand years ago), and more recently in connection with trans-Saharan commercial routes. In this study, we describe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity of human populations from both sides of the Sahara Desert, i.e., both from North Africa and the Sahel/Savannah belt. The final dataset of 7213 mtDNA sequences from 134 African populations encompasses 470 newly collected and 6743 previously published samples, which were analyzed using descriptive methods and Bayesian statistics. We completely sequenced 26 mtDNAs from sub-Saharan samples belonging to the Eurasian haplogroup N1. Analyses of these N1 mitogenomes revealed their possible routes to the Sahel, mostly via Bab el-Mandab. Our results indicate that maternal gene flow must have been important in this circum-Saharan space, not only within North Africa and the Sahel/Savannah belt but also between these two regions.",
            "Keywords:Sahel/Savannah belt, North Africa, mtDNA diversity, population history",
            "The out-of-Africa event, during which a relatively small group of anatomically modern humans spread from East Africa into Eurasia [1], was a defining moment in the evolution of modern humans. Although paleoanthropology has detected several older waves of Middle Pleistocene migrations from Africa to Eurasia [2], genetic studies show that contemporary non-sub-Saharans are descendants of an ancestral population that spread from Africa only about 60 ka (thousands of years ago) [3]. Leaving aside the long-term isolation of Khoisan populations in southern Africa and of the Pygmies in the tropical rain forests of central Africa, the out-of-Africa event is nowadays considered to be the most significant restriction of gene flow between two groups of anatomically modern humans: the sub-Saharans and non-sub-Saharans had been separated by the Sahara Desert throughout most of prehistory. Differentiation between these groups is apparent in both mitochondrial (mtDNA) [4] and nuclear [5] DNA diversity. Due to this separation, we can detect different mtDNA haplogroups, which can be assigned either a sub-Saharan or Eurasian ancestry [6]. While the basis of the sub-Saharan mtDNA gene pool is classified as macro-haplogroup L, the rest of the world nowadays traces its maternal ancestry from haplogroup N or M [7].",
            "That, however, does not mean that after the out-of-Africa event migration had stopped. The genetic structure of inhabitants of the Sahel/Savannah belt was analyzed by researchers with respect to their linguistic affiliation, subsistence structure, and geographic localization of local populations [8,9,10], and both population genetics and phylogeographic studies highlighted the significance of gene flow. The Sahel/Savannah belt has therefore been called a \u201cbidirectional corridor of migrations\u201d [11] and evidence of gene flow was also detected across the Sahara in populations inhabiting regions between the Sahel/Savannah belt and North Africa [12,13].",
            "Interestingly, while some migrations may have had an ethnic association, others did not. For instance, the origin of the Chadic-speaking peoples living in the Lake Chad Basin was traced to East Africa based on linguistic evidence [14]. According to this theory, the ancestors of current Chadic-speaking peoples migrated, still as nomadic herders, from the Nile Valley through Wadi Howar to the Ennedi Mountains, and further through Wadi Hawash up to the Lake Chad Basin. Genetically, the Chadic-speaking peoples nowadays harbor mtDNA sequences belonging to the L3f haplogroup with East African ancestry, especially a private branch L3f3, which formed during their westward expansion of about 8 ka [15]. On the other hand, another mtDNA haplogroup, called L3e5, which was also detected in populations living today in the Lake Chad Basin but not only in Chadic-speaking populations, is also present in the Maghreb and its origin can be traced to an ancestral population that crossed the green Sahara during the Early Holocene approximately 10 ka [13].",
            "Sahelian populations also carry Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups. They are found more frequently in the nomadic pastoralists than in sedentary farmers [16] and a surprising finding showed that some sub-Saharan Africans and even Northern Eurasians share some very recent maternal ancestry. For instance, it was shown that a Saami from Scandinavia and a Yakut from Siberia share with a Berber and a Fulani mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroup U5b1b [17]. Given the enormous geographical distances between these populations, the most plausible explanation is that the most recent common ancestor (~8.6 ka) lived probably in southwestern Europe, from where the descendants spread both to northern Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa. A more detailed study of originally Eurasian lineages beyond the Sahara has shown that not only U5b1b but also the H1 haplogroup (which both occur mainly in the Fulani pastoralists) came to form the new and younger sub-Saharan lineages called U5b1b1b and H1cb1 [18]. Their most recent common ancestor (~4 ka) dates to the time when, according to archaeology [19,20,21], the first herders settled in the western Sahel/Savannah belt.",
            "It may therefore seem that the pastoralist food-production strategy did not spread to sub-Saharan Africa by demic diffusion from the Near Eastern domestication center via northeastern Africa, but through the ancestors of Berbers from the Maghreb. In this context, it should be noted that the genetic architecture of the circum-Mediterranean space had undergone substantial changes since the Neolithic. For instance, ancient Near Eastern farmers are genetically better represented by the current populations of central and western Mediterranean, such as the Sardinians and the Basques [22,23], than by the current populations of the Near East.",
            "The importance of post-Neolithic gene flow from northwestern Africa to the western part of the Sahel/Savannah was also suggested by research on lactase persistence. In fact, the Fulani pastoralists from Burkina Faso share with Europeans the extended haplotype carrying Eurasian variant \u221213,910 \u00d7 T. It was suggested that their ancestors received this haplotype via admixture with the Eurasian population two times [24]. The first event is genetically dated to ~1828 years ago and the second one to ~302 years ago, whereby it seems that the admixture involved a group related to southwestern Europeans. Moreover, the geographical distribution of lactase persistence variants in the Sahel/Savannah belt shows clear differences between the pastoralists in the east (mostly Arabs harboring variant \u221213,915 \u00d7 G) and the west (mostly Fulani harboring variant \u221213,910 \u00d7 T) [25]. In fact, a boundary between the western and eastern Sahelian genetic spaces lies somewhere near the Lake Chad Basin, as attested not only by lactase persistence but also by a genome-wide SNP study [26].",
            "Last but not least, it was shown that Sahelian pastoralists tend to represent several mutually similar mtDNA haplotypes, which indicates either more recent origins of their diversity, isolation of their demes, lower gene flow, or lower effective size of the population [10]. Interestingly, thanks to coalescence analyses, it was possible to show there is an asymmetric gene flow between the pastoralists and the farmers in both parts of the Sahel/Savannah belt: while the western (Fulani) pastoralists are losing their mtDNA diversity, the eastern (Arabs) pastoralists are gaining it by admixture with local sub-Saharan agricultural populations [27]. This is further supported by the presence of various sub-Saharan mtDNA haplotypes in the gene pool of Arabic-speaking populations [9], mostly non-carriers of the lactase persistence \u221213,915 \u00d7 G variant [28]. Interestingly, this genetic observation might correspond to a process of Arabization and/or language shift after the expansion of Arabs and their culture from North Africa into the Lake Chad Basin, from the 14th century AD onwards [29].",
            "The above-mentioned studies show that inclusion of newly collected local populations, especially from the Sahel/Savannah belt, has significantly contributed to our knowledge of the peopling of Africa north of the equator by discoveries of not only new variants\u2014which happens quite commonly when a new dataset of a sub-Saharan population is presented [30]\u2014but even of entire new mtDNA haplogroups. In fact, since all new sub-Saharan population studies published so far revealed new genetic variants, one ought to admit we are so far aware of merely a fraction of the genetic diversity of sub-Saharan populations [31,32].",
            "Because sub-Saharan Africa is still underrepresented in population genetic and genomic studies [30], we compiled a large mtDNA database composed of both newly collected and previously published mtDNA sequences and produced an updated survey of migration patterns in the circum-Saharan space. Additionally, we performed a complete mtDNA sequencing of the N1 haplogroup from sub-Saharan Africa, with most samples from the Sahel/Savannah belt but some also from East Africa. The N1 haplogroup\u2019s southwestern Asian ancestry is well known and goes as far as to ~60 ka [4] but its African phylogeny is still not well understood. We selected the N1 because this haplogroup was reintroduced back to the Sahel/Savannah belt by migration from southwestern Asia, possibly via North Africa, as became apparent when a related basal branch was recently discovered in a North-African skeleton (Takarkori rock shelter, Libya) dated to ~7 ka [33]. We can thus assume that phylogeny of this specific haplogroup could document an ancient gene flow back to Africa in the eastern circum-Saharan region.",
            "We built a large dataset of 7213 mtDNA hypervariable segment 1 (HVS-1) sequences from 134 African populations inhabiting the circum-Saharan space. It contains both published and newly acquired samples. All samples were collected with the help of African colleagues and appropriate informed consent was procured prior to sampling from all participants. Newly collected and here for the first time presented mtDNA (n= 470) sequences enriched the Sahelian dataset with four populations from Mali (n= 135), three from Mauritania (n= 191), and three from Sudan (n= 144). During the sampling, we focused on populations that have not been previously included in any genetic study, such as the Bella from Mali, Imraghen from Mauritania, Daju and Zaghawa from Sudan, but also on populations whose sampling coverage was insufficient due to their large geographic dispersals, such as the Fulani from Mali and Mauritania, Moors and Soninke from Mauritania, and Tuareg, Songhai, and Arabs from Mali.",
            "The population dataset (Supplementary Table S1) was further divided according to three variables: from the perspective of subsistence strategy (lifestyle), each population was categorized as belonging either among pastoralists or farmers, from the perspective of language affiliation, populations were classified as belonging to one of three language families (Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan, and Afro-Asiatic), and from the geographic perspective we divided populations in western Sahel/Savanah, western North African, eastern Sahel/Savannah, and eastern North African groups (Figure 1).",

            "Subsequently, we selected from our collections for complete mtDNA sequencing 26 DNA samples which, according to HVS-1 using the rCRS-oriented version of Build 17 on the PhyloTree website [34], belong (together with its daughter clade I) to haplogroup N1. For selected details of the N1 sample, seeSupplementary Table S2. Subsequently, we compared these mitogenomes with worldwide samples (n= 701) belonging to the same N1 haplogroup. Our total N1 dataset thus includes 727 mitogenomes (Supplementary Table S3).",
            "New samples published here for the first time were collected by the Oragene DNA Collection saliva kit (DNA Genotek Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada). DNA was extracted according to supplier\u2019s protocol. PCR amplification of all newly sequenced samples (n= 470) was carried out using primer pairs previously published in Gonder et al. [35]. Due to differences in the lengths of mtDNA sequences published in available comparative studies, sequences analyzed in this study were restricted to a highly polymorphic segment of 339 bp (nps 16,032\u201316,370). The region between positions 16,184 and 16,194 was excluded from analyses because of uncertainty regarding its correct alignment which arose in consequence of heteroplasmy observed in several samples [36].",
            "Samples selected for whole mtDNA sequencing were analyzed using the Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS) method. Quantity of the extracted DNA was determined by Plexor HY (Promega) and the samples were diluted to the total DNA template of 15 ng per reaction. Whole-genome mtDNA MPS data were generated using commercially available QIAseqTM Targeted DNA Panel (Qiagen), which contains 222 overlapping primers, and then sequenced on MiSeq Fgx Sequencing system (Verogen) in the \u201cResearch Use Only\u201d mode through the \u201cGenerate FASTQ\u201d with \u201cFASTQ Only\u201d application and \u201cPaired End Read\u201d.

Significant results could indicate not only natural selection but also demographic expansion or contraction of effective population size. Tajima\u2019s D and Fu\u2019s Fs tests were calculated in the same version of Arlequin using 10,000 iterations [37], while R2 tests were computed by using DnaSP ver. 6.12.03 [41]. Statistical tests and confidence intervals for R2 were based on parametric bootstrapping with coalescence simulations. It should be noted that in order to reject neutrality at 5% level of significance in Fu\u2019s Fs statistic, thep-value should be below 2% (because it is tested by a unilateral test). Additionally, we evaluated demographic history by Harpending\u2019s raggedness index (Hri) and the sum of squared deviations (SSD) while considering a model of demographic expansion as implemented in Arlequin [42].

By inspecting the fixation indices, we were able to describe the structure between groups (for \u03a6CTindex) and/or relationships between populations within groups (for \u03a6SCindex).

The estimated parameters were \u0398 for population size (from which we could calculate effective population size via \u0398 = 2Ne\u00b5 for haploid mtDNA data) and M (immigration rates), both scaled to mutation rate, with settings of one long chain; 1,000,000 genealogies with every 5000 recorded; and a burn-in per replicate of 10,000.

ML estimates of branch lengths were obtained using PAML 4.8a [55] while assuming an HKY85 mutation model with \u03b3-distributed rates (approximated by a discrete distribution with 32 categories), partitions (the two hypervariable regions as a block vs. the remaining mtDNA genome), and a generation time of 25 years.

One can also observe that sedentary farmers are slightly more diverse than nomadic pastoralists are, especially in the eastern part of the investigated regions. Our results regarding the distribution of these indices within language families may be affected by unequal representation of individual populations in groups because the Afro-Asiatic family is much better represented than other families: for instance, the Nilo-Saharan family is represented in our dataset by just 14 populations. A Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way test (Table 1) indicated statistically significant differences from both the perspective of nucleotide diversity and the mean number of pairwise differences among all the groups (except for those based on lifestyle, which seems to significantly differ from the perspective of haplotype diversity).

Interestingly, the newly introduced populations collected in the Sahel/Savannah belt are distributed not only within their own genetic space: some, such as the Moors from Mauritania and Arabs from Mali, are located within the area covered by North African populations.

On the other hand, we were able to confirm the structure when considering languages or regionally divided populations (Region1 and Region2), or when the farmers/pastoralists in North Africa were contrasted with farmers in the Sahel/Savannah belt. Our results show rather balanced indices indicating no significant structure among pastoralists in North Africa and the Sahel/Savannah belt (\u03a6CT= 0.0674, \u03a6SC= 0.0765).

Moreover, we calculated the immigration rates and the numbers of immigrants into specific groups. Surprising results are seen in North African populations (in particular eastern pastoralists and western farmers), who seem to have received the least number of immigrants from other regions. On the other hand, we ought to consider the differences in sample sizes of these groups: for eastern North African pastoralists, we had just 195 samples, while for western North African farmers we had 2343.

When we look at the age of the N1a1a and N1b2 clusters (Table 2andSupplementary Table S9), we can see age estimates at most around 20 ka, whereby these should be interpreted as the upper limit age of introgression of these lineages into the Sahel.",

First of all, we were able to show that North African populations have lower values of nucleotide diversity, especially in the western part of the region. This can be attributed to their lower effective population sizes, as attested also by the Bayesian coalescent approach employed in this study. When contrasting pastoralists with farmers, we found similar distributions of diversity values, which supports our previous finding of no significant structure associated with the subsistence strategy in the Sahel/Savannah belt [10].",
            "The lower level of differentiation among the populations of North Africa than among the populations of the Sahel/Sudan belt supports the idea of higher migration activity homogenizing the gene pool and eroding the population structure in the southern Mediterranean space. It is well possible that there was a long-range influx of population(s) from the Near East to the Maghreb already in preagricultural times [50]. In fact, this finds support in recent aDNA analyses of Iberomaurusian skeletons [57]. Interestingly, both Natufian and Iberomaurusian specimens show a high level of Basal Eurasian ancestry, which was a population isolated > 50 ka in a Late Pleistocene refugium of the Arabo-Persian Gulf without contacts with the Neanderthals [58]. Further immigration to North Africa took place in the Neolithic and in later times both from the Near East [59,60,61] and from Europe via the Strait of Gibraltar [62,63,64,65]. According to our results, it seems that this expansion through populations of farmers reached all the way to the western Sahel/Savannah belt. It should also be noted that the general genetic homogeneity of North African populations is reflected in the linguistic homogeneity of Afro-Asian languages.",
            "Our results which suggest that the eastern part of North African populations received immigrants from the Sahel/Savannah belt do not correspond with research on autosomal SNP variants, which had shown that the populations of Egypt and Libya are composed predominantly of a Near Eastern genetic component with very low input from sub-Saharan Africa [50]. However, that may be due to the fact that the last-mentioned study worked with limited sub-Saharan (and not really Sahelian) samples as the putative sources of migration to their North African datasets. In fact, a subsequent study revealed in some North African populations (e.g., in Algeria) a higher gene flow from the sub-Saharan space, especially in maternal lineages [66]. In Egypt, the importance of a migration corridor via the Nile Valley was described a number of times both in archaeology [67] and in genetics [68,69]. Moreover, many eastern Sahel/Savannah populations also have an admixture of sub-Saharan and Eurasian ancestries; especially the Arab groups have an important Eurasian component. This is thus why the sub-Saharan input in North Africa is larger in the west than in the east. Another point is that the sub-Saharan influence in North Africa was mainly via maternal lines: higher in mtDNA, almost nonexistent in the Y-chromosome, and intermediate in the autosomal DNA [70].",
            "Migrations in the Sahel/Savannah belt were probably less important than in North Africa. When we look at the continent-wide African mtDNA diversity, the Sahel/Savannah belt can be viewed as a corridor between the Sahara and tropical rainforests which connects eastern and western Africa but also has\u2014especially in the Lake Chad Basin\u2014some distinctive genetic features [11]. Food-producing strategies came to play an important role in demographic expansions in this region later than in North Africa, especially in the Holocene. The first expansion may have been related to pastoralism, which is a strategy perfectly well-adapted to Sahelian dryland ecosystems [71]. It spread through the Sahel/Savannah belt from northeastern Africa during the Holocene [72,73,74]. An expansion of herders started ~8 ka in northeastern Africa but was relatively slow because it reached the western Sahel/Savannah belt much later, at about 3 ka [75].",
            "The cultivation of cereals and tubers, which is autochthonous in the Sahel/Savannah belt (especially in and around the Middle Niger Delta [76,77,78,79] and in the Middle Nile Valley [80]) was somewhat delayed because the first fully domesticated plants were consumed in Africa only about 4.5 ka. At present, the majority of Sahelian economics is based on mixed agro-pastoralism [81] but in many Sahelian countries, we still find purely nomadic pastoralists. We can thus see that a somewhat delayed spread of a particular food-production subsistence strategy may result in a lower migration activity and higher population differentiation. Despite some morphological differences detected between present-day full-time nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers [82], our genetic analyses show that lifestyle cannot be considered a determinative parameter of population sub-structuring in Africa, at least when considering the entire circum-Saharan region and not just the Sahel/Savannah belt where the biological separation of lifestyles may have played a more important role.",
            "It seems that periodically, both in a long-term and short-term view, an increase in the size of the shallow Lake Chad in the middle of the east-western Sahelian corridor presented an obstacle to gene flow, forming a cul-de-sac. This can be documented by the spread of two different populations of nomadic pastoralists: in the west the Fulani, such as Wo\u0257aa\u0253e, and in the east the Arabs, such as Baggara or Shuwa. While the Arabs are of Eurasian (Arabian) ancestry and received gene flow from sub-Saharan Africans [28], the Fulani are of western African ancestry and their ancestors acquired some Eurasian ancestry by admixture with a northern African population possibly related to the Berbers [24,27]. Since the level of this admixture is relatively high (analyses show around 20% of a Eurasian component), it might be responsible for the noticeable differences between local Fulani populations and the surrounding relatively homogeneous Sahel/Savannah gene pool. On the other hand, the genetic diversity of sedentary farmers suggests that they lived in reproductively more isolated groups, which led to genetic drift and isolation by distance [10]. Interestingly, this can be associated also with the genetic diversity of their pearl millet landraces grown by different ethnolinguistic groups, especially in the western part of the Lake Chad Basin [83].",
            "Finally, we found that the N1 haplogroup, which diversified in southwestern Asia some 55 ka [4] and its younger lineages expanded across all Eurasia, is present also in eastern Africa and the Sahel/Savannah belt. On the other hand, the age estimates of N1 mitogenomes we detected in our Sahelian populations are much younger and thus congruent with population contacts via Ba el-Mandeb or the Red Sea [84], not via the southern Mediterranean space. Moreover, two ancient samples from Takarkori rock shelter in Libya dated to ~7 ka [33] are highly distinct from our N1 Sahelian and eastern African samples because they branched off before all the current N lineages (far away from N1). We did not find any traces of local expansion of mtDNA N1a lineages into the Sahel/Savannah belt, as described for example for the Y chromosome R1b-V88 haplogroup [85,86] or for L3f3 mtDNA haplogroup [15]. This kind of (maternal) Eurasian N1 impact is visible mainly in eastern Africa, especially in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, and not further in the central or even western part of the Sahel/Savannah belt close to the Lake Chad Basin. In fact, migration associated with this N1 African diversity might be associated with the Late Pleistocene/Holocene expansions in Arabia and the neighboring region and more recently also with the spread of Ethiosemitic languages into Ethiopia at ~3 ka (for example N1a3a+195C!), which continued further to South Africa [87] and not to the west.",

            "The Neolithic burial of Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo (CS) represents a unique archaeological finding for the prehistory of Southern Italy. The unusual placement of the inhumation at a rather high altitude and\u00a0far from inhabited areas, the lack of funerary equipment and the\u00a0prone deposition of the body\u00a0find limited similarities\u00a0in coeval Italian sites. These elements have prompted wider questions on mortuary customs during the prehistory of Southern Italy. This atypical case requires an interdisciplinary approach aimed to build an integrated bioarchaeological profile of the individual. The paleopathological investigation of the skeletal remains revealed the presence of numerous markers that could be associated with craft activities, suggesting possible interpretations of the individual\u2019s lifestyle. CT analyses, carried out on the maxillary bones, showed the presence of a peculiar type of dental wear, but also a good density of the bone matrix. Biomolecular and micromorphological analyses of dental calculus highlight the presence of a rich Neolithic-like oral microbiome, the composition of which is consistent with the presence pathologies. Finally, paleogenomic data obtained from the individual were compared with ancient and modern Mediterranean populations, including unpublished high-resolution genome-wide data for 20 modern inhabitants of the nearby village of San Lorenzo Bellizzi, which provided interesting insights into the biodemographic landscape of the Neolithic in Southern Italy.",

            "At the end of the sixth millennium BCE, Neolithic lifeways are well established in Southern Italy (SI)1. Pottery appears in the archaeological record of the Early and Middle Neolithic phases in Apulia, Basilicata and Calabria; the hunting-gathering economic system starts to be replaced by the spread of farming activities, even though a complete shift to an agriculture-based subsistence strategy does not occur before the Bronze Age2. Radical changes can be seen in the settlement strategies during the Early and Middle Neolithic phases in SI, mostly based on the occupation of coastal and sub-coastal areas, such as Favella di Corigliano (CS), representing one of the most ancient farming villages in Italy, and one of the first pottery-industry in Central-Western Europe3. By contrast, evidence of human presence in the inner territories of SI are sporadic until the advanced phases of the Neolithic. In such context, the archaeological site of Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo represents a unicum for the human exploitation of SI during the Neolithic.",
            "Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo is an extended limestone massif located on the Calabrian side of the Pollino National Park (Fig.1a), in the municipality of San Lorenzo Bellizzi (Cosenza). The massif is extremely rich in cavities, with at least 21 vertical and horizontal caves surveyed in the area. Among them, Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo preserves the most ancient evidence of human activity in Northern Calabria4. The location of the cavity (Fig.1b) at a rather high altitude (>\u20091000\u00a0m asl) and not easily visible from the valley, has allowed it to survive post-depositional disturbances. The stratigraphic reconstruction of the archaeological deposit testifies a consistent use of the small cavity (less than 20\u00a0m in length) throughout the Neolithic period, as suggested by the presence of trichrome, bichrome and impressed ware, while scarce and sporadic evidence of a more recent frequentation has been attested.",
            "",
            "(a) Geographical location of San Lorenzo Bellizzi. Maps were obtained from the National Geologic Map Database project (https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/) and adjusted using Adobe Illustrator 2022 v3.0 (available athttps://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/); (b) Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo massif and the entrance of the homonymous cave (black circle); (c) planimetry of the cave and location of the burial (red square); extent of the excavations is highlighted in green; (d) the skeletal remains of the individual as found inside the cave; (e) the intact jaws of the individual; photographs taken by Felice Larocca (b,d) and Alessandra Cinti (e).",
            "The archaeological excavations conducted since 2017 revealed the presence of a single burial located a few meters from the entrance of the cavity (Fig.1c). The skeletal remains (Fig.1d) were found inside an ovular pit directly carved in the ground: the buried individual (SLB henceforth) was found prone, E\u2013W oriented, face turned to the earth and in an extremely contracted position; medium-sized stones covered the skull and the right side of the body, with smaller stones lying above the pelvis, trunk, and limbs. Despite a consistent anthropogenic presence in the cave, marked by evidence of pottery fragments associated with the Diana and Serra d\u2019Altofacies5, the cave did not yield any further signs of funerary activity. The lack of funerary equipment, along with the use of a simple pit inside a cave, led to a Neolithic contextualization of the burial. This was later confirmed by radiocarbon analysis, which placed SLB within the Middle Neolithic (6092\u2009\u00b1\u200945 BP; 5207\u20135048\u00a0cal BCE, 19,1%/5084\u20134899\u00a0cal BCE, 74,8%/4864\u20134853\u00a0cal BCE, 1,5%)6. However, the individual from Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo represents an interesting exception in the funerary landscape of the Italian Neolithic: single inhumations, during the earliest and the more advanced phases of Neolithic in SI, are generally found within the domestic area, with the body lying on one side, mostly buried in pits directly carved in the ground or inside silos and niches7\u20139. Evidence of mortuary depositions far from inhabited areas can be found throughout the Neolithic in proper Apulian funerary contexts, such as necropolis10and burial cavities11,12. However, considering the location of the cave and the problems that arise in accessing it, due to the presence of steep vertical crags, this burial constitutes a unique archaeological marker of human Neolithic presence in the mountains of SI. Moreover, the unusual placement of the burial inside the cave, located only a few meters from the entrance and partially exposed to natural light, raises questions on the funerary habits of Neolithic humans in SI, and more specifically on the life history of the individual. We wondered if the genetic ancestry, the state of health, occupation or social identity could somehow be connected to the unconventional burial. A well-established methodological approach combining biomolecular archaeology, physical anthropology and archaeothanatology13\u201316was able to provide answers to some of these questions, and helped us reconstruct an almost complete bioarchaeological profile of the individual. Anthropological and paleopathological investigations of the remains have been supplemented with computerized tomography scanning of the mandible and the maxilla (Fig.1e). The presence of dental calculus has allowed the characterization of the microdebris trapped in the mineral matrix, as well as the recovery of interesting information on the composition of the oral microbiome and the potential state of disease thanks to the combination of metagenomics and paleoproteomics analyses. Finally, a complete mitochondrial genome and the first whole genome data from prehistoric Calabria have been produced through shotgun sequencing. In fact, while ancient DNA approaches have been applied to investigate the Neolithic transition in Northern17\u201319, Central20, and insular Italy21\u201323, few ancient DNA data have been produced yet for prehistoric SI24\u201326and very little is known about the paleogenomic landscape of Calabria27. Thus, genomic data obtained here were investigated in the context of modern and ancient variability of Mediterranean populations. To improve our understanding of population dynamics, samples of 20 modern autochthonous individuals from the village of San Lorenzo Bellizzi were collected and genotyped for\u2009~\u2009720,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).",
            "The skeletal remains of the individual were found in a very contracted position, with the torso prone, the face resting on the bottom of the pit, with elbows and knees bent; both forearms were placed under the body, with the lower limbs reassembled on the right side and arranged with the legs hyper-flexed on the thighs. The mandible and the maxilla were found in full occlusion. The primary character of the deposition has been defined by the correct anatomical arrangement of the skeletal elements and by the persistence of labile connections; the absence of disjunction of the vertebral spaces, the maintenance of the volume of the rib cage, and the anatomical connection of the bones of the hands and feet suggest that the decomposition occurred in a filled pit28. The individual, an adult male \u00b1\u200930\u00a0years old, about 164\u00a0cm\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0cm tall, showed extreme wear patterns on the teeth (Fig.2a), involving the complete loss of crown height in the lower incisors. Dental enamel is almost absent from the occlusal surface, leaving a nearly continuous dentinal surface surrounded by a partial rim of enamel, and causing a remarkable reduction in tooth size.",
            "",
            "(a) Mandibular portion of the jaws with visible extreme forms of wear patterns; (b) stereomicroscopic images of the occlusal surfaces of lower incisors and canines, with clear evidence of streaks (bottom and central) and fractures (top); (c) CT images of the jaws.",
            "Numerous streaks were visible by stereomicroscopy in all directions on the occlusal surfaces of lower incisors and canines (Fig.2b), as well as crown fractures and signs of chipping on the anterior mandibular and maxillary teeth. A more pronounced oblique wear on the lingual surface of the maxillary teeth and on the buccal surface of the mandibular teeth (friction) is present, along with signs of wear on the tooth surface (abrasion), particularly evident on the mandibular and maxillary first molars; chipping and fractures of the crowns on the posterior teeth (molars) are also visible. Diffuse recession of the alveolar bone and exposure of the dental roots are present as well as anintra-vitamloss of the second maxillary right premolar, probably following an abscess within the alveolar bone. Small amount of calculus on the teeth surfaces were also identified.",
            "CT-investigation of the jaws (Fig.2c) reported a good density of the bone matrix, consistent with the age of the individual; a generalized bone absorption is visible at the alveolar level, indicating the presence of a periodontal disease that could have led to the loss of the maxillary second premolar. The relationships between the two jaw bones show a forward sliding of the lower jaw (class III) in head-to-head closure of the incisors. It allows us to estimate an original position of the lower jaw (in class I) that changed over time due to the lack of occlusal mandibular and maxillary stability.",
            "Regarding the postcranial skeleton, abnormal bone formation or destruction patterns were observed at the level of the joints. Moderate marginal osteophytes have been detected on the right and left upper extremity (proximal epiphysis of the right ulna and distal epiphysis of the right and left radius) and on the pelvic girdle (left acetabulum). Depressed surfaces with smooth edges were observed on the right distal surface of humeral\u00a0trochlea (10\u00a0mm long), on posterior surface of the left and right tarsal navicular bones (about 3\u00a0mm long) and on the first proximal phalanx of the right toe (concal proximal facet, 10\u00a0mm long). Such patterns are typical of osteochondritis dissecans, a pathological condition of the subchondral bone supporting cartilage of synovial joints, consisting in the partial or complete detachment of articular cartilage from subchondral bone29. Patterns of abnormal bone formation and destruction were identified at the shafts. Non-specific periostitis on the midshafts of tibiae and fibulae is visible, and moderate abnormal bone formations in the form of enthesopathies are present, affecting the inferior surface of both clavicles at the attachment of the ligament of the conoid process and the sites of flexor tendons on palmar surface of proximal hand phalanges. Severe oval grooves are evident along the inferior surface of the right clavicle at the attachment of the costoclavicular ligament (rhomboid fossa); on the left clavicle the lesion appears as moderate depression (enthesopathies), while on the upper humeral shaft, moderate depression at the attachment of the pectoralis major muscle is present. Abnormal bone shapes have also been detected, involving a probable greenstick fracture of the right clavicle and backward inclination of the tibial plateau.",
            "Finally, a lateral extension of the articular surface of the right glenoid cavity occurs on the insertion of inferior glenoid labrum; no ossification of ligaments and tendon attachment are present as well as no osteophytes, indicating a possible instability or flexibility of the shoulder joint. Squatting facets are present on the anterior surface of the trochlea of talus and on the anterior margin of the lower end of the tibial extension, indicating a habitual contact between the two anatomical elements29.",
            "The microdebris analysis of dental calculus revealed the presence of a variety of poorly diagnostic microremains (SupplementaryInformation). Most of these were of plant origin and consisted of starch granules (Supplementary Fig.2A), plant tissues (Supplementary Fig.2B), a trichome (plant hair, Supplementary Fig.2C), but in most cases they could not be assigned even to Family level. Two of the plant remains retrieved were consistent with fibers (Supplementary Fig.2D,E), but they were of low diagnostic nature, too. Dark brown particles (Supplementary Fig.2G) might be evidence of micro-charcoal, but they also lacked secure distinctive features, therefore they were described as \u2018burnt debris\u2019\u2014to acknowledge their uncertain nature. There was also mineral grit (Supplementary Fig.2F), but optical microscopy alone does not allow the identification of such remains, and it will be subject of future analysis. Despite the poor diagnostic nature of the remains, they suggest the consumption of starchy food and leafy crops. The presence of remains such as fibers and mineral grit, that may have contributed to the dental wear of the individual, could also be associated with occupational activity. However, the very limited quantity of potential textile fibers and their insecure identification make it difficult to provide a clear interpretation. In fact, fibers can also be found in calculus sample where no dental wear patterns are reported30, and thus extreme caution must be taken in the interpretation of these remains.",
            "Paleogenomic analysis was performed on dental calculus to define the ancient oral microbial community of SLB. Single-stranded genomic libraries were built from ancient DNA extracts of dental calculus and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X platform, producing 7,695,982 paired-end reads. We applied HOPS31, a tool specifically conceived for the taxonomic characterization of short-read shotgun metagenomic data. Several host-associated bacteria have been identified in the dental calculus, among which different members of the generaTreponema, Prevotella, Streptococcus and Methanobrevibacterare present (a list with the 50 most abundant microbial species identified in the dental calculus is reported in Supplementary TableS1).As expected for dental calculi samples, members of bacterial genera associated with both human host and environment (e.g.,Actinomycesspp., Streptomycessp.and Pseudomonasspp.) were also detected. The ancient origin was validated by evaluating the number of reads for each specific taxon, the post mortem degradation score (PMDS), the negative difference proportion score (\u2212\u0394 %) and the presence of pattern of deamination C-T. Taxa with more than 300 assigned reads, more than 50 reads with PMDS\u2009>\u20091,\u2009\u2212\u2009\u0394 %\u2009>\u20090.9 and showing patterns of C-T transition at 5\u2032 were considered to be of ancient origin (Supplementary TableS1) A large number of reads assigned to previously identified human oral taxa sustained deamination and substitution profiles that are consistent with ancient DNA (e.g.,Treponema denticola,Actinomyces dentalis,Streptococcus gordonii,Methanobrevibacter oralis,Porphyromonas gengivalis,Prevotella intermedia). Of the species retrieved,Treponema denticola,Tannerella forsythiaandPorphyromonas gingivalisconstitute the most pathogenic aggregate of oral bacteria, namely the \u201cred complex\u201d, recognized to be strongly associated with periodontal disease32,33. The occurrence of these three species in terms of number of reads (TableS1) is in line with the expected abundance, as highlighted in other studies34. The oral metagenomes detected from dental calculus were compared in Principal Coordinates Analysis (Fig.3) with available ancient oral microbiomes data of Neanderthal (n\u2009=\u200914, green), pre-agricultural (n\u2009=\u200951, orange), Neolithic (n\u2009=\u200916, yellow), pre-antibiotics (n\u2009=\u200915, blue) and modern (n\u2009=\u200918, light blue) origin35,36. Notably, 16 of these metagenomes belong to ancient Italian individuals geographically and temporally matching with our sample. The oral microbiome of SLB (red dot) lies in proximity to samples of Neolithic/pre-agricultural origin, indicating a major sharing of taxa with microbiomes of this period as expected by the age of the sample. To further investigate the metagenomic component of the individual, ancient DNA sequences generated from tooth dentin of SLB (see section \u201cAncient human DNA\u201d) were also screened for the most common bacterial pathogens, as suggested by the literature37,38. According to our findings, no DNA traces of potential pathogens were found (Supplementary TableS2). It must be noted however that pathogen DNA may not have been preserved through time on the dentin due to the conformation and thickness of the different bacterial cell walls39or because some pathogens do not enter the bloodstream and are most likely undetectable40. Moreover, our analysis is completely blinded to viruses, especially RNA viruses, whose genetic material is hardly preserved in ancient samples, and few attempts to sequence ancient transcriptomes have been published so far41.",

            "Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) of the ancient oral microbiome content for SLB (red) and 114 samples from Neanderthal (green), pre-agricultural (orange), Neolithic (yellow), pre-antibiotic period (blue) and modern-day humans (light blue). Ellipses indicate the 95% confidence areas based on the standard error of the means of distances among samples of the same group.",
            "Paleoproteomics of a small dental calculus sample yielded 1309 unique protein hits (SupplementaryDataset). Among these, 27 belong to the host (Supplementary TableS3) and most (20) are associated with the innate immune system (Supplementary Fig.S3). Others are related to hemostasis, the metabolism of proteins and the digestion of dietary carbonate (amylases). Most of the identified proteins were of bacterial origin (1271). The analysis of the taxonomic composition of the ancient microbiome is complicated by the fact that the same peptide sequence may be found in several taxa, leading to multiple hits. Nonetheless, considering the taxa that yielded the highest number of protein hits,Arachniaspp.,Actinomycesspp.,Streptococcusspp.,Fusobacteriumspp.,Corynebacteriumspp.,Olsenellaspp. andOttowiaspp. are the most represented. All these taxa are components of the healthy core oral microbiome (eHOMDhttps://www.homd.org, accessed 11/01/2023). The presence ofTreponemaspp. andTannerellaspp., present among the \u201cred complex\u201d bacteria, is confirmed also from the proteome. Other bacteria of potential interest includeAggregatibacterspp.,Cardiobacteriumspp.andEikenella corrodens, regular components of a healthy microbiome, but which can, in rare cases, be the cause of infective endocarditis42.",
            "Ancient DNA was extracted from one molar of SLB to test for endogenous DNA persistence and provide a genetic profile of the individual. The extracts were converted into single-stranded genomic libraries and sequenced for a total of 531 million reads on Illumina HiSeq-X Ten Platform. The endogenous DNA retrieved reported a genome-wide coverage of 0.24X, with\u2009>\u2009290,000 SNPs overlapping the 1240\u00a0K\u2014Human Origins SNP Array v54.1 (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data). Deamination patterns among the sequences were consistent with the age of the sample (Supplementary Fig.S4), and the presence of modern contamination was excluded both at the X-chromosome (6%) and mitochondrial level (2%) (Supplementary TableS4). A 39-fold complete mitochondrial genome was reconstructed from the individual, reporting 33 unique variants when compared to the rCRS. The mitochondrial haplogroup has been assigned with 99% accuracy to K1a\u2009+\u2009195 haplogroup. The Y-chromosome haplogroup was identified as a G2a2a1 by comparing high quality reads of SLB to an informative list of Y-chromosome SNPs (https://isogg.org/tree/). Both the X/autosomes coverage ratio and Y/sex chromosomes coverage ratio suggest the individual to be male, confirming the outcome of the anthropological investigation. A phylogenetic tree (Fig.4a) was reconstructed to investigate the clustering of the individual in the landscape of prehistoric K-related mitochondrial lineages, and SLB clusters in proximity with other K1a\u2009+\u2009195, in particular with one individual from the Neolithic settlement of Makotrasy (I14173, Baalberge culture, Czech Republic) dated 4300\u20133500 BCE. Interestingly, the MJN performed for mitochondrial variability shows SLB being few nodes far from another K1-related prehistoric individual from Italy, the Iceman43, whose rare mitochondrial haplogroup has been identified only within the Alps area (Supplementary Fig.S5).",

            "Under a diachronic and geographical population perspective, we compared our sample with ancient and modern populations using principal component analysis. PCA projection on a dataset of ancient samples shows how SLB falls into the variability of the Italian and Mediterranean Neolithic, near Peloponnesian and Anatolian Neolithic individuals (Fig.4b).",
            "The SLB individual was then projected on a dataset of 737 modern Italians (Fig.4d), representative of the genetic variability of Italy (see \u201cMaterial and methods\u201d section), merged with unpublished genomic data obtained from 20 modern inhabitants of the nearby municipality of San Lorenzo Bellizzi. The geographic clustering of the samples reveals a clear latitudinal gradient along the peninsula, where the Sardinian cluster is clearly separated from the rest. The modern inhabitants of San Lorenzo Bellizzi cluster together, in close proximity to the Southern Italian control group, but do not overlap with it; instead, they appear separate from the rest of the modern samples, indicating a possible isolation and a subsequent genetic drift effect. Despite being geographically close, the Neolithic individual SLB does not fall within the variability of modern groups, within that of the modern inhabitants of San Lorenzo Bellizzi, nor within the genetic variability of the South.",
            "Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo is located at a substantial altitude, on a vertical crag that is extremely difficult to reach. Despite the many cavities that have been surveyed in the area of the rock massif, this is the only one where the presence of Neolithic funerary activities has been identified thus far. The typological characteristics of the burial found inside the cave designate it as a remarkable finding for the prehistory of Southern Italy. Similar types of deposition, with a single individual buried in a prone and huddled position, with the face turned towards the ground, can be found in Palata di Canosa44, Pulo di Molfetta45and Titolo di Bari-Palese9, three Apulian sites dated to the Ancient and Middle Neolithic. It must be noted however that these burials are located in typical funerary contexts, within or in proximity of the villages. If one considers (1) the more general typological evidence of burying the deceased in a huddled position inside the pit, (2) the widespread presence of covering stones, and (3) the total absence of funerary equipment, more similarities can be found with the infant burial of Grotta di San Michele in Saracena46and in the funerary area of the Neolithic village of Favella3. However, the social meanings that underlie the heterodox funerary behaviour expressed in Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo are difficult to be addressed. When compared to other similar archaeological contexts in Northern Ionian Calabria, such as the nearby caves of Cassano allo Ionio47, the absence of further human remains suggests that Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo had a marginal role as a burial site during the Middle Neolithic. Moreover, the extreme contraction of the body inside the pit proposes two interpretative scenarios: a critical frailty of the subject, which could have allowed the lower limbs to be easily flexed; the possible presence of ropes that kept the limbs together. The arrangement of the body with stones covering its entire extent could be associated with the practical aim of locking the body in the lying position. Furthermore, the completely unnatural position of the upper limbs and the hands could also indicate that the body has been arranged in such a position during the burial, either at a moment close to death, or in a later phase of at least 24\u201336\u00a0hours, i.e. the necessary time whereupon rigor mortis ceases48. Despite the lack of anthropological elements that could be directly related to the cause of death, several skeletal features identified through macroscopic investigation allow us to make some considerations on the lifestyle of the individual. The analysis of the post-cranial skeleton provides information related to acute or repeated moderate microtrauma on the shoulders (suspected greenstick fracture, enthesopathies), upper limbs (osteophytes, osteochondritis dissecans, enthesopathies), pelvic girdle and lower limbs (osteophytes, periostitis, osteochondritis dissecans). These alterations might be related to a general biomechanical stress on bones and joints that could also generate peripheral aspecific bone inflammation in the lower limbs29,49. In addition, bilateral squatting facets of the tibia and talus, and the backward inclination of the tibial plateau have been taken as evidence of hyper-flexion at the hip and knee joints and hyper-dorsiflexion at the ankle and subtalar joints; these joint markers are related to habitual use of the squatting position during life as well as prolonged standing and walking on hard/impervious surfaces50\u201352and/or to genetic traits53. Overall, stress-induced skeletal remodeling involving different bones in a moderate way, suggests that a variety of repeated physical activities could have played a role in the lifestyle of the individual. The analysis of the dental wear provides evidence for the use of the mouth for non-alimentary purposes, as a non-specific tool or \"third hand\". The extreme forms of wear patterns of the lower incisors and the presence of micro-grooves on the occlusal surfaces have been taken as evidence of extra-masticatory activities and the reduction in tooth size has been described in literature as the results of the combined effects of occlusal and interproximal wear54,55. Dental wear patterns of masticatory type attributable to friction and abrasion have been observed in posterior teeth, even if the asymmetrical wear (more prominent on the right side) might be a diagnostic element related to activities such as the preparation of food or the processing of hard or resistant materials. Furthermore, the microdebris identified through morphological investigation confirms the utilization of the mouth for non-alimentary purposes. No diagnostic elements relating to the diet were found, but the presence of magenta minerals and fibers could be associated with the use of the mouth as a third hand during the production of craft objects. While it is difficult to link these fibers securely to a craft activity, the presence of marked dental wear on the teeth of SLB and the presence of fibers could be an indication of some fiber-based craft. Such evidence has been attested in other coeval funerary contexts in SI, such as Serra Cicora in Apulia, and associated to an employment of the mouth as a working tool10.",
            "Among the dental pathologies detected, chipping and fractures of the tooth\u00a0crowns have been taken as evidence of chewing of hard particles56,57. Finally, diffuse recession of the alveolar bone and exposure of the dental roots have been related to inflammation of soft tissues (periodontal disease, gingivitis)58. This paleopathological evidence is concordant with the biomolecular data obtained from dental calculus.",
            "Paleoproteomics analyses of the calculus showed the presence of a rich oral microbiome, dominated by bacterial taxa commonly found in plaque and oral cavity. The authenticity of non-human peptide sequences, which could indicate the presence of dietary proteins (e.g.,Bos tauruscollagen), cannot be firmly established and therefore no further interpretation is attempted. The metaproteome data are consistent with the metagenomic analyses, showing the presence ofActynomycesandStreptococcusas well as ofTreponemaandTannerellaspp.,the latter being typical of periodontal disease. In particular, metagenomic analysis highlighted the persistence of the Gram-negative bacteriaTreponema denticola,Tannerella forsythiaandPorphyromonas gingivalis, which are part of the so-called \u201cred complex\u201d bacteria, known to be strongly associated with periodontal disease32,33, but also to a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer59,60, diabetes mellitus61,62, and are proposed as a risk factor for other several syndromes63,64. Among the bacteria of potential interest detected,Aggregatibacterspp.,Cardiobacteriumspp., andEikenella corrodens, which are usually part of a \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome, could be in rare cases associated with the development of infective endocarditis42. The presence of dental pathologies and the detection of amylases are perfectly in line with the consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, typically Neolithic, diet. Proteomics can also detect the immune response of the host, and several human proteins were observed including numerous components of the innate immune system, e.g., neutrophil degranulation and antimicrobial peptides (Supplementary Fig.S3). This provides confirmation at the molecular level of the fact that the individual had suffered from infections during his life65\u201368.",
            "Due to the poor preservation of the remains during the archaeological investigation, the individual was initially identified as a female4. However, ancient DNA data and laboratory analysis of the skeletal remains led to an undoubted identification of the individual as a male, confirming the outcome of a recent anthropological investigation6. PCA projection of the genetic data on the dataset of ancient samples shows how SLB falls into the variability of the Italian and Mediterranean Neolithic, near the Peloponnesian and Anatolian Neolithics. This Neolithic genetic signature finds support on the uniparental haplogroups recovered from SLB: both K1a branches of mitochondrial DNA and G2a Y-chromosome sub-lineages have been indicated as part of the Neolithic genetic component that reached the European continent 8000\u00a0years ago, with G2a sub-haplogroups being the most widely distributed uniparental lineages among Neolithic Europeans69,70(Fig.4c). When compared to modern populations, SLB shifts in proximity of the Sardinian cluster, which has been reported to retain the greatest proportion of Neolithic ancestry among all Italian samples71\u201374. On the basis of modern data, the genetic prehistory of SI has been proposed to be the result of different migratory events from those that shaped the Eastern and Central Europe ancestrality, with Mediterranean genetic links between Aegean populations and SI that have been traced back to Neolithic period75,76. The genetic contributions that linked SI with the Greek islands and Anatolia have suggested the possibility that the Mediterranean could have served as a complementary crossroad for migratory events that occurred during the Neolithic77, even though such possibility cannot be fully explored with a single individual from Calabria. Nevertheless, the paleogenomic landscape of prehistoric SI is far from being understood, and new data are needed to better understand the legacy of ancient migrations in this region. The paleogenomic results presented in this work are certainly affected by the low number of SNPs used, but they represent another important step for archeomolecular studies in the Southern regions of the Italian peninsula.",
            "The results of such an interdisciplinary study allowed us to reconstruct an almost complete bioarchaeological profile of the individual. Whether the funerary anomaly expressed in Grotta di Pietra Sant\u2019Angelo could be related to necrophobic or ritual practices, such theories cannot be clarified through the outcome of this interdisciplinary research. However, some of the evidence we gathered suggests interesting possibilities. The absence of traces of trauma on skeletal remains and the presence of bacteria potentially related to inflammatory diseases, combined with the detection of human proteins of the innate immune system, could suggest the persistence of a non-specific inflammatory state with potentially fatal consequences. The possibility that the individual may have died away from his community would explain the unorthodox choice of burying the person in a site where no specific mortuary functions have been attested. Despite the lack of a clear funerary equipment, the burial itself could be defined as the expression of carefully planned social behaviour, especially considering the difficulties that arise in accessing the cavity. The contribution of geochemical methodologies such as stable isotopes analysis, not applied in this study, could be beneficial to better understand the provenance of the individual. Furthermore, the authors hope that in the near future new molecular data may be generated from Calabria, whose rich prehistory deserves to be explored through integrated approaches.",

            "The examination of the position of the bones was carried out in situ before the detachment of the skeleton from the ground following the methodological indications of Crubezy et al., 199078and Duday, 200628. A preliminary anthropological investigation6was focused on biological parameters assessment such as age-at-death, sex and stature; anthropological data, were acquired through macroscopic morphological observation and metric survey of the bones, according to the main methods reported in the literature79\u201389.",
            "Paleopathological analysis of the skeleton was applied to identify and describe macroscopic abnormalities on bones and joints, both in the axial and appendicular skeleton (Supplementary Fig.S1). Paleopathological analysis was conducted by direct inspection, and medical computed tomography (acquisition parameters: 1.25 section thickness, reconstruction interval 0.6\u00a0mm, 120\u00a0kV and 100\u00a0mA) carried out at UO of Radiology at the Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital in Forl\u00ec. Visual assessments include identification of pathological lesions and their distribution within the affected bones and joints, and descriptive summary of the type of the abnormal features49. Descriptive analysis may provide important datasets for more in-depth paleopathological research.",
            "Microdebris analysis was performed on dental calculus retrieved from the first right lower incisor, in which the presence of wear on the occlusal surface could indicate a use of the mouth as a \"third hand\". The protocol was based on previous studies65,90. Following the extraction of the calculus and a decontamination step to eliminate elements deriving from the burial soil, the sample was decalcified in a weak solution of hydrochloric acid (0.6\u00a0M HCl). This step dissolves the inorganic matrix and extracts all the microdebris that have been incorporated within the calculus throughout the life of the individual. The observation of the microdebris was carried out using a polarizing optical microscope with transmitted light. The slides were scanned at magnification of 160x, 400x, 1000\u2009\u00d7\u2009using a Leica ICC50 W optical microscope. The microdebris (Supplementary Fig.S2) were divided into morphotypes based on the morphology and a name, a description and hypothesis on the origin and method of incorporation assigned to each. Any suggested identification is based upon their anatomical characteristics and comparison with modern reference material and key reference texts90\u201399.",
            "Sample preparation for paleoproteomics was carried out at the dedicated ancient protein laboratory (\u201cArchaeobiomics\u201d) at the University of Turin, following international guidelines for minimizing contamination and ensuring the authenticity of the sequences100. In brief, the sample (PALTO 247) was weighed (7.6\u00a0mg), washed in 200 \u03bcL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (EDTA, 0.5\u00a0M, pH\u2009=\u20098) for ten minutes, then demineralized in 500 \u03bcL 0.5\u00a0M EDT with gentle agitation (450 RPM) for eight days. The demineralized sample was processed following the SP3 protocol for low-protein samples101. Following the reduction of disulphide bonds with dithiothreitol (1\u00a0M aqueous solution) at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min and alkylation with iodoacetamide (0.5\u00a0M aqueous solution) at room temperature for 45\u00a0min, 30 \u03bcL of Sera-Mag SpeedBeads (1:1 mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic) were added to each of the extracts. To induce binding, 100% EtOH (HPLC-grade) was added to a final EtOH concentration of 50% and incubated at 24\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min at\u2009~\u20091000\u00a0rpm. The tubes were then placed on a magnetic rack for separation, the supernatant removed and discarded. The proteins bound to the beads were cleaned with 80% EtOH (3X), exchanged to buffer (50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5\u20138) and the mixture sonicated for 30\u00a0s. After this step, trypsin was added (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg, Promega, proteomics grade) for overnight digestion at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and light shaking was applied (~\u20091000\u00a0rpm). Afterwards, the extracts were centrifuged for 1\u00a0min, placed on a magnetic rack, the supernatants containing the digested peptides were transferred to separate tubes, acidified with 10% TFA (to a final TFA concentration of 0.1%) and the samples purified using C18 solid-phase extraction tips (Pierce, Thermo-Fisher). Eluted peptides were evaporated to dryness.",
            "Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) analyses were performed at The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. The dental calculus sample (PALTO 247) was preceded by one lab control (ancient mollusk shell A) and two wash blanks and followed by one wash blank and one laboratory control (ancient mollusk shell control B). Dried peptide eluates were resuspended in 30 \u03bcL 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in water and transferred to a SpeedVac\u2122 Concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Denmark) vacuum centrifuge at 40\u00a0\u00b0C until approximately 5 \u03bcL of the solution was left. 15 \u03bcL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 5% ACN was then added to each well. Samples were then separated on a 15\u00a0cm column (75\u00a0\u03bcm inner diameter) in-house laser pulled and packed with 1.9\u00a0\u03bcm C18 beads (Dr. Maisch, Germany) on an EASY-nLC 1200 (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) connected to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) on a 77\u00a0min gradient. Four microliters of the sample/control were injected. LC and MS parameters were run according to the dental calculus method in Scorrano et al.102, with the HCD collision energy at 30%, RF Lens at 40%, and MS2 inject time of 54\u00a0ms to adjust for differences between the mass spectrometers.",
            "Raw mass spectrometry data were searched against a combined database of Uniprot (Universal Protein Database, downloaded 06/12/2022) and eHOMD (expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database, downloaded 06/12/2022) protein sequences using the PEAKS Studio XPro software. Outputs of Spider searches carried out including all possible modifications and amino acid substitutions, were considered for further analysis. The thresholds for peptide and protein identification were set as follows: peptide score\u2009\u2212\u200910lgP\u2009\u2265\u200930, protein score\u2009\u2212\u200910lgP\u2009\u2265\u200940, de novo sequences scores (ALC%)\u2009\u2265\u200980, unique peptides\u2009\u2265\u20092. To ensure that all sources of contamination were considered, the results discussed here are based on the set of proteins which remain after all proteins found in the blanks and control are removed (the unfiltered results are reported in SupplementaryDataset).",
            "The whole dataset was also used for estimating the extent of deamidation, both overall and site specific, using the DeamiDATE tool103. The raw MS data were first searched using MaxQuant v.1.6.3.4104with a database made of all positive protein hits from the PEAKS search. Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a fixed modification; oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), pyroglutamic acid (QE), and hydroxyproline were all set as variable modifications. Digestion was set to trypsin with a maximum of two missed cleavages. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% and the minimum score cut-off for modified and unmodified peptides was 50. All other parameters were left for the default for orbitrap mass spectrometers. All laboratory and handling contaminants were removed from the results.",
            "The analyses were conducted at the Ancient DNA Laboratory of the Department of Cultural Heritage (University of Bologna), following strict standards for paleogenomic workflow105,106. A second lower left molar was isolated for ancient DNA extraction (SLB2). The tooth was smoothly cleaned with 4% HCl, rinsed in 80% EtOH and then sterilized under UV-light for 20\u2019. 1\u20132\u00a0mm external surface of the root was then abraded with a rotatory blade to remove superficial layer, and 60\u00a0mg of cementum and dentin powder was collected by drilling the root at low speed with dental bit. For metagenomic analysis, a 15\u00a0mg fragment of dental calculus (SLBT) was sampled from the second lower left incisor and after 20\u2019 UV irradiations, it was powdered on sterilized mortar for DNA extraction. DNA isolation was performed as in Dabney et al. (2013) with slight laboratorial modifications as in Cilli et al. (2020)107and molecular concentrations were measured on QuBit fluorometer. Blank controls were processed along with the samples during every phase of the analysis. Single stranded libraries were then built for both extracts108, pooled at equimolar amounts with other samples and screened for endogenous DNA on HiSeqX Ten 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u00a0bp lane. Once confirmed the presence of authentic ancient DNA, SLB sample was sequenced a second time on HiSeqX Ten 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u00a0bp lane, generating\u2009>\u2009500 million reads.",
            "Raw data were processed with Paleomix109: the fastq files were filtered with AdapterRemoval110that removed adapters and reads shorter than 30\u00a0bp. Reads were then separately aligned to the Human Reference Genome (GRCh37) and to an elongated version of the rCRS using Circular Mapper v1.93.5 (https://github.com/apeltzer/CircularMapper) and bwa v0.7.17 aln algorithm111, with minimum mapping quality\u2009\u2265\u200920, seeds disabled and parameter \u2212\u2009n set to 0.01. PCR duplicates were automatically removed and the authenticity of the reads was confirmed by evaluating the patterns of deamination at both ends of the reads with mapDamage v2.2.1112. Modern human contamination was estimated at mitochondrial and X-chromosome level via Schmutzi113and ANGSD v0.939114respectively. We used Schmutzi to generate the consensus sequence of the mitochondrial DNA, and the haplogroup was assigned with HaploGrep2115and Haplofind116. The\u2014rescale option from mapDamage was used to downscale the quality values of likely-damaged positions of the reads due to ancient DNA damages. Then, a list of informative SNPs for Y-chromosome was downloaded from the International Society of Genetic Geneaology (https://isogg.org/tree/), and the software yhaplo (https://github.com/23andMe/yhaplo) was used to identify Y-chromosome haplogroup from reads with mapping quality scores\u2009\u2265\u200930 and bases with quality scores\u2009\u2265\u200930. Biological sex of the individual was estimated by computing the ratio of reads aligning to the X-chromosome as a portion of the total sequences mapping to the autosomes using the R script provided in Mittnik et al. 2016117. The results were also compared with the sex assignment approach provided by Skoglund et al. 2013118, that calculates the ratio of reads mapping to Y-chromosome as a portion of the alignments to the sexual chromosomes. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with the software MEGA X119using a dataset of 130 Chalcolithic to Middle Late Neolithic Eurasians of haplogroup K (Supplementary TableS5), by setting the substitution model HKY\u2009+\u2009I\u2009+\u2009G, assessed by JModelTest2120and running 1000 bootstrap repetitions. The Median Joining Network (Supplementary Fig.S5) was performed with Network software v.10 (www.fluxus-engineering.com) using default parameters on a set of 53 K1a (n\u2009=\u200919), K1a\u2009+\u2009150 (n\u2009=\u20093), K1a\u2009+\u2009195 (n\u2009=\u200930) and K1f.

            "Pseudohaploid genotypes were called from reads with mapping quality\u2009\u2265\u200930 using PileupCaller, (https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools) that randomly selects one high quality base (phred base quality score\u2009\u2265\u200930) based on the 1240\u00a0K reference panel. Minimum base and mapping quality of 30 filters were applied for the samtools mpileup command, and pseudo-haploid data generated by randomly calling one allele from each covered site using the pileupCaller script. For the contextualization of SLB in the ancient Mediterranean variability, a dataset of 905 ancient individuals was selected from the 1240\u00a0K\u2014Human Origins SNP Array (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data).

            "A representative panel of 1257 modern individuals to be used as a reference base for the PCA projection was extracted from the HumanOrigins dataset. These contain a lower number of markers (~\u2009600\u00a0K SNPs) but have the advantage of having a good coverage of all populations and of being already merged with the ancients, which simplifies the procedure and avoids further reductions in the number of variants when merging. Therefore, we obtained a comparison panel of 2162 IND and 431,156 SNPs (Supplementary TableS7) from ancient and modern Euro-Mediterranean populations. The data of ancient SLB were then merged with the custom dataset, for a total 92,322 SNPs remaining after further pruning (using a 200 25 0.4 filter). Finally, we did the PCA projection of the ancient individuals with SLB on the modern Euro Mediterranean HOs, and the resulting plots were divided in four temporal screens, namely Mesolithic, Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age (Supplementary Fig.S6).",

The 20 samples were merged with 737 already published individuals, representative of the genetic variability along the Italian peninsula, as well as Sardinia121. Merging was performed with the PLINK v.1.9122by taking into consideration only autosomal SNPs that were shared across the two datasets, obtaining a new set of 757 individuals and 254,709 variants. A standard quality control was then carried out with functions implemented in the same PLINK package to ensure a high quality for the resulting final dataset of modern individuals. Specifically, data missingness was checked across SNPs and across individuals with a threshold of 0.05, leaving 254,614 SNPs and 757 individuals; the respect of Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium was also inspected, imposing a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to the standard threshold of 0.01, so that the new threshold is equal to 3.9275e\u22128. Variants in linkage disequilibrium were also tested using a sliding window approach with a window of size 500 SNPs, a step of 50 SNPs and a LD threshold of 0.1 and, if detected, one variant was randomly removed from the dataset. The complete QC returned 49,586 SNPs and 757 individuals.

The reads assigned to bacterial genomes were extracted with the MaltExtract tool and realigned to their respective reference genomes to evaluate edit distances, coverage distributions, and post-mortem DNA damage patterns31,125,126. To this aim, we used MapDamage112to estimate deamination rates. Post-mortem degradation score (PMDS) distributions were computed using PMDtools127. The breadth and depth of coverage were estimated using bedtools128. Edit distances for all sequences compared to their references were used for calculating the negative difference proportion score (\u2212\u0394 %) as previously described by H\u00fcbler and colleagues (2019)31. A \u2212\u2009\u0394 %\u2009>\u20090.9 was considered as relevant for a declining distribution related to ancient DNA profile.

            "The Canary Islands\u2019 indigenous people have been the subject of substantial archaeological, anthropological, linguistic and genetic research pointing to a most probable North African Berber source. However, neither agreement about the exact point of origin nor a model for the indigenous colonization of the islands has been established. To shed light on these questions, we analyzed 48 ancient mitogenomes from 25 archaeological sites from the seven main islands. Most lineages observed in the ancient samples have a Mediterranean distribution, and belong to lineages associated with the Neolithic expansion in the Near East and Europe (T2c, J2a, X3a\u2026). This phylogeographic analysis of Canarian ancient mitogenomes, the first of its kind, shows that some lineages are restricted to Central North Africa (H1cf, J2a2d and T2c1d3), while others have a wider distribution, including both West and Central North Africa, and, in some cases, Europe and the Near East (U6a1a1, U6a7a1, U6b, X3a, U6c1). In addition, we identify four new Canarian-specific lineages (H1e1a9, H4a1e, J2a2d1a and L3b1a12) whose coalescence dates correlate with the estimated time for the colonization of the islands (1stmillennia CE). Additionally, we observe an asymmetrical distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in the ancient population, with certain haplogroups appearing more frequently in the islands closer to the continent. This reinforces results based on modern mtDNA and Y-chromosome data, and archaeological evidence suggesting the existence of two distinct migrations. Comparisons between insular populations show that some populations had high genetic diversity, while others were probably affected by genetic drift and/or bottlenecks. In spite of observing interinsular differences in the survival of indigenous lineages, modern populations, with the sole exception of La Gomera, are homogenous across the islands, supporting the theory of extensive human mobility after the European conquest.",
            "The Canaries archipelago is located off the southern coast of Morocco (Fig 1). Due to their oceanic volcanic origin, they have probably never been connected to the continent. Mediterranean sailors discovered several groups of islands in the Atlantic Ocean in the 13thcentury, but only the Canary Islands were found to be inhabited by an indigenous population [1]. European chroniclers recorded that different islands were inhabited by populations exhibiting different ways of life and speaking distinct dialects of what they believed to be a Berber language. Ethno-historical sources provided ethnonyms for the native population of each island (e.g. Guanches for Tenerife, Benehaoritas for La Palma, and Bimbapes for El Hierro). However, for clarity, we will refer to them in general terms, as the Canarian indigenous or native population.",

            "Chroniclers were amazed to discover that the Canarian natives were unaware of navigational methods and had remained isolated from the African continent [2,3]. During the 15thcentury, the Spanish kingdom of Castile gradually conquered all of the Canary Islands, after previous European attempts. In most of the islands, the indigenous people resisted the European conquest [4]. The crushing of the resistance, and subsequent European colonization, had a great impact on the indigenous people [5]. In spite of the abolishment of slavery on the Islands in 1498, a large number of natives were deported during and after the conquest [6]. Those that survived and stayed progressively mixed with the European colonizers, leading to the loss of indigenous culture and language.",
            "The geographic origin of the Canarian indigenous people was initially inferred from both the interpretation of historical written sources and the analysis of archaeological evidence. Most archaeological and anthropological data support a North African origin for the Canarian indigenous people, relating to the Berber populations [7,8]. Key evidence supporting a Berber origin includes inscriptions belonging to the Libyco-Berber and Lybico-Canarian alphabets [9,10], pottery [11], communal granaries [12], and domestic species [13\u201315]. Non-metric dental traits [16\u201318] and morphological analyses of cranial and long bones [19,20] also show similarities between current inhabitants of Northwest Africa and the Canarian indigenous people.",
            "In regards to the time of the arrival of the first population groups, some authors have proposed the first millennium BCE as the upper bound for human presence in the archipelago [21], based on radiocarbon dating of charcoal and sediment samples. In addition, there is evidence of a Roman short-stay settlement in Lobos islet dated during or before the first centuries of the present era [22], which did not, according to the archaeological data, involve attempting to colonize the Canaries. Recently, there has been an effort to review and contextualize radiocarbon dates in the Canary Islands to better assess the time of the archipelago\u2019s indigenous colonization. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) analyses support a later colonisation of the Canary Islands dating to the outset of the first millennium AD. If only AMS analyses performed on short-lived samples are considered [23], the earliest dates from the eastern islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura range between 100\u2013300 cal AD [21,22], whereas those from the central island of Gran Canaria range between 400\u2013500 AD [3]. The oldest AMS dates from Tenerife are around 660\u2013880 cal AD [24], while the western islands of La Palma, El Hierro and La Gomera yield AMS dates ranging respectively between 260\u2013450 cal AD [24], 420\u2013610 cal AD [24], and 120\u2013330 cal AD [25]. On the other hand, older radiocarbon dates that place the arrival of human populations before the 1stcentury BCE were obtained from sediment, wood and charcoal samples that could be older than the archaeological site where they were excavated.",
            "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a powerful tool for inferring the geographic origin of populations [26]. MtDNA is maternally inherited, does not undergo recombination and its different lineages are geographically structured in human populations. For those reasons, mtDNA has been widely applied in phylogeographic studies. The analysis of current Canary Islands samples using mtDNA has provided support for a North African origin for the indigenous people, based on the presence of the mtDNA U6 haplogroup [27], which has a clear Berber ascription [28,29]. Within the U6 lineages observed in the current Canary Islanders, it is worth mentioning U6b1a, a haplogroup that is not present today in North Africa and which is considered a Canarian autochthonous lineage [30]. Interestingly, U6b1a\u2019s coalescence age (3,600 years ago) predates the proposed time of arrival of the first inhabitants of the islands, suggesting an origin in North Africa [30]. Other haplogroups observed in the current Canarian people have Eurasian (H, T, J\u2026), sub-Saharan African (L1, L2 and L3) and Amerindian (A2 and C1) affiliations [31]. These results highlighted the multiethnic nature of the modern population of the Canary Islands, correlating with historical events, such as the implementation of a slave workforce for the sugar cane plantations, or the commercial connection with the Americas in the colonial period [32]. The detailed analysis of current mtDNA of the modern Canary islanders has also suggested possible origins for the indigenous population, including Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria or Sahara, but an overall agreement has not yet been reached [31,33].",
            "Regarding the colonization model, linguistic research has pointed to at least two migration waves from North Africa [10,34]. Also, the observation of different cultural backgrounds affecting the island of La Palma has been interpreted as evidence of consecutive migrations. The specific timing for those migrations is still unclear, except for La Palma, where the second wave of migration has been proposed to have taken place around the 10thcentury [7]. This idea has also been supported by asymmetrical distribution of both mtDNA [31] and Y-chromosome lineages [35] in the modern Canarian population. The first colonization wave may have affected the entire archipelago, creating the substrate population and bringing mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplogroups observed today in most of the islands, including the mtDNA lineages U6b1a or H1cf. The second colonization would have brought new migrants to certain islands and created an asymmetrical distribution of haplogroups, such as T2c1 and U6c1.",
            "The direct analysis of ancient remains from the Canary Islands, using mtDNA by means of PCR techniques, confirmed the presence of North African markers in the indigenous people, including the U6b1a haplogroup, as well as some of the Eurasian lineages observed in the modern population [36]. Admixture analysis based on mtDNA data, using the natives as parental population, determined that 42% of modern Canarian mtDNA lineages have an indigenous origin [36]. Ancient mtDNA results from four of the seven islands found high diversities for Tenerife and La Palma [33,36,37], and the partial and complete fixation of certain haplogroups in La Gomera [38] and El Hierro [39], suggesting that the colonization of the archipelago was a heterogeneous process and that different islands could have had different evolutionary histories.",
            "Although previous ancient DNA (aDNA) studies have been fundamental to understanding the origin and evolution of the Canarian population, most of the ancient mtDNA data produced so far has been obtained using PCR amplification. This classical aDNA technique has provided valuable information, but results have always been hindered by the risk of sample contamination. This is due to the fact that aDNA from warm climates is often extremely degraded and the PCR technique is highly sensitive, thus minute amounts of modern contaminant DNA can be preferentially amplified [40]. Additionally, because the molecules are short and degraded, aDNA analyses based on PCR amplification have tended to isolate small, but informative, regions of the mitochondrial genome, such as the hypervariable region (HVR). This partial information does not allow for refined classification within haplogroups, which is needed to discriminate between close geographical regions. This is especially true within haplogroup H, which comprises ~40% of the ancient Canarian mtDNA lineages. The advent of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) has greatly expanded the capacity of aDNA research. NGS allows damage patterns that are unique to aDNA, such as short fragment size and post-mortem damage, to be detected easily, thus authenticating mtDNA results. NGS also has the advantage of providing complete mtDNA genomes to allow a better geographic assignment, compared to those obtained from partial HVR sequences.",
            "A recent NGS study of the Canarian indigenous people presented the first complete mtDNA genomes and low-coverage full genomes from this population, and, more specifically, from the central islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria [41]. However, previous aDNA data [36\u201339] suggested that the indigenous populations from different islands might have experienced different demographic processes. The inclusion of data from all seven islands is therefore of paramount importance to accurately characterizing the archipelago\u2019s indigenous population. Additionally, to fully benefit from the potential of ancient mtDNA data, a more detailed phylogeographic analysis is required.",
            "In order to obtain a comprehensive mtDNA perspective on the origin of the indigenous people of the Canary Islands, we have applied aDNA protocols and NGS to assemble ancient mtDNA genomes from all seven sub-populations. Since human remains from warm regions like the Canary Islands are expected to have low endogenous DNA content, we applied an enrichment technique [42] to improve mtDNA coverage and reduce sequencing costs.",
            "Samples were collected in collaboration with both Canarian universities, La Laguna (Tenerife) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Gran Canaria), as well as the insular museums of Gran Canaria (El Museo Canario), La Palma (Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Benahorita) and La Gomera (Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico de La Gomera). Information about specimens used in this study is available inS1 File. A total of 25 archaeological sites were selected for this project (Fig 1). Radiocarbon calibrated dates are available for several sites (S1 Fig;S1 Table): El Agujero (1030\u20131440 cal AD), La Angostura (1318\u20131394 cal AD), Las Arenas (540\u2013650 cal AD), El Capricho (400\u2013480 cal AD), Cascajo (1640\u20131700 cal AD), Cuermeja (1270\u20131316 cal AD), La Fortaleza (599\u2013633 cal AD), Guayadeque (540\u2013737 cal AD), El Hormiguero (1020\u20131160 cal AD), Huriamen (1015\u20131050 cal AD; 1080\u20131150 cal AD), Lomo Gale\u00f3n (1260\u20131290 cal AD), Monta\u00f1a Mina (1313\u20131365 cal AD), El Pescante (150\u2013350 cal AD), Portillo (1500\u20131580 cal AD), Puente de La Calzada (1265\u20131312 cal AD; 1358\u20131388 cal AD), Punta Azul (1015\u20131155 cal AD) and El Salitre (1060\u20131179 cal AD). For those sites with no available calibrated dates (Antoncojo, Barranco Majona, El Cedro, Cueva del Agua, El Espig\u00f3n, Huerto de Los Morales, Los Pasitos and Salto del Casimiro), their assignation to the indigenous population was based on general context, the archaeological remains themselves and the presence of specific funerary practices. Sample CAN.005 is a tooth sample that was taken from a private collection of ancient human remains donated to El Museo Canario (Gran Canaria, Spain). Although this sample is not associated with any specific archaeological site, its calibrated radiocarbon date (1265\u20131312 cal AD) is in agreement with a pre-Hispanic origin. It is also worth mentioning that some archaeological sites from Tenerife (Cascajo and Portillo) are from the post-conquest period [43], but they are associated with the so-called \u201cAlzados\u201d, indigenous people that rebelled against the European colonizers and retired to the mountains, leaving all contact with the Europeans behind [44].",
            "Best-conserved samples were selected for DNA extraction. Although the petrous bone is considered the best source for aDNA [45], we used teeth and small bones (e.g. phalanx) to avoid destroying valuable archaeological material.",
            "Required precautions were taken during the handling of samples, and all experiments that included aDNA were carried out in dedicated, clean lab facilities at the Paleogenomics Lab, University of California Santa Cruz, to avoid contamination. DNA extraction was performed following Dabney et al. [46]. Bone samples were sanded to remove the external surface, and then one bone piece was cut with a Dremel tool and pulverized using a bone mill. The surface of tooth samples was decontaminated using a bleach solution, and then the teeth were cut down the midline and the cementum drilled using a Dremel tool and a metallic bit. Pulverized bone and tooth samples were incubated overnight, using a proteinase K/EDTA solution, and DNA extracted using a silica-based and guanidine method. Ancient DNA was then built into double-stranded libraries, with 7-bp single-index barcoding to allow for multiplexing sequencing, following Meyer and Kircher [47]. Libraries were sequenced for an initial screening on an Illumina NextSeq 500 apparatus for obtaining paired-end shotgun data (~1 M reads per library) with a sequencing read length of 2 x 75 bp.",
            "After the screening of shotgun libraries, those samples with an endogenous DNA content lower than 10% were enriched using whole-genome in solution capture [42]. Briefly, aDNA libraries were captured in singleplex reactions using human genomic RNA baits, with the aim of increasing endogenous DNA rates and reducing sequencing costs. Although this method is directed at capturing the whole genome, multicopy regions of the mtDNA become particularly enriched. Post-capture libraries were sequenced as indicated before, to obtain at least ~5 M reads per post-capture library.",
            "In order to perform population-based analyses, we included in our study previously published [36\u201339] and unpublished HVR data from the seven islands. Newly reported HVR data from the islands of El Hierro (n = 7), Gran Canaria (n = 77), Lanzarote (n = 5) and Fuerteventura (n = 10) was obtained following the methodology described by Maca-Meyer et al. [36] and Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez et al. [39]. Briefly, after external decontamination, tooth samples were extracted by means of a GuSCN-silica based protocol. MtDNA quantification was performed on a 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA), using a human-specific mtDNA fluorescent probe [48], and ~3,000 copies were submitted to PCR with the aim of reducing the effects of DNA damage. The mtDNA HVRI (from positions 16,000 to 16,400) was amplified using seven overlapping fragments, with sizes ranging from 82 to 124 bp, to improve the amplification of endogenous DNA. All the sequencing reactions were prepared with the BigDye v3.1 Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and run on an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Standard contamination prevention and monitoring were conducted as described earlier [39].",
            "We included in this study several current Canary Islands mtDNA genomes, analyzed using both whole-genome and Sanger sequencing. Complete genomes were obtained in Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Energ\u00edas Renovables (ITER) by whole-genome sequencing from a set of 18 unrelated Canarians. Briefly, DNA samples were processed with a Nextera DNA Prep kit, with dual indexes following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Library sizes were checked on a TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and their concentration determined by the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Samples were sequenced to a depth of 30X on a HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina) with paired-end 150-base reads. Sanger sequencing mtDNA genomes were obtained at University of La Laguna following previously published methodologies [49], for samples classified as T2c1 and L3b1a (determined by HVRI analysis). These samples were selected because of their potential to define new sub-lineages within T2c1 and L3b1a.",
            "Submission to the Stanford Institutional Review Board was waived because this research does not involved human subjects, we did not interacted with study subjects and because the specimens were collected for purposes other than the current research. Consent was not obtained for this study because data were analyzed anonymously.",
            "Shotgun sequencing reads were trimmed and adapters removed using AdapterRemoval version 1.5.4 [50]. Specifically, the paired-end reads were merged, and low-quality bases (BASEQ < 20) and short reads (< 30 bp) removed. Merged trimmed reads were then mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using BWA version 0.7.12 [51], while unmerged reads were discarded. Unmapped, low-quality (MAPQ<30) and duplicate reads were removed using SAMtools version 0.1.19 [52]. The percentage of endogenous DNA was calculated by dividing the number of reads remaining after filtering by the total number of trimmed reads.",
            "Damage patterns were assessed using MapDamage v2.0 [53]. Insert size of libraries was obtained with SAMtools mpileup, and plotted using R software v.3.2.0 [54]. Contamination rates of libraries were calculated using contamMix v.1.0\u201310 [55] and Schmutzi [56].",
            "MtDNA reads were directly mapped to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [57] and filtered as described before. MapDamage was used to rescale the quality of bases likely affected by post-mortem damage. Indel Realigner from the GATK pipeline version 2.5.2 was also used for improving alignment quality around indels [58]. MtDNA consensus sequences were obtained using SAMtools and BCFtools version 0.1.19 [52]. A list of variants was then obtained using SAMtools mpileup, with a minimum depth of 5. Haplogroups were determined with HaploGrep version 2.0 [59], using PhyloTree build 17 version (http://www.phylotree.org) [60]. MtDNA haplotypes were manually curated by visual inspection, using Tablet v.1.17.08.17 [61]. Modern DNA sequencing data was analyzed following the same protocol used for ancient samples, except for the MapDamage rescaling step. After retrieving all available mtDNA genomes belonging to the haplogroups of interest from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), phylogenetic trees were built using median-joining networks [62]. Indels around nucleotides 309, 522, 573 and 16193, and hotspot mutations (e.g. 16519) were excluded from phylogenetic analysis. For estimating coalescence ages for specific clades, we used the \u03c1 statistic [63]. We used a mutation rate for the complete mtDNA sequence of one substitution in every 3,624 years, correcting for purifying selection as in Soares et al. [64]. Accompanying standard errors were calculated as per Saillard et al. [65]. For highly frequent haplogroups, such as H1cf and T2cd3, we only kept one sample per site, to avoid relatedness interfering with coalescence age estimations.",
            "Newly reported HVR sequences were analyzed using BioEdit software v.7.0.9.0 [66], and haplotypes were obtained by means of HaploSearch software [67] and further confirmed by manually inspecting the electropherograms. Haplogroup nomenclature was assessed following the most updated mtDNA phylotree (Build 17) [60].",
            "NGS data was combined with previous HVRI sequencing data to perform population-based analysis. Published samples used for comparisons are detailed inS2 Table. As we do not know if samples in the same burial can be related, when several samples with the same haplogroup were observed from the same archaeological site, only one was included in the analysis. Two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to assess differences in mtDNA haplogroup frequencies between eastern and western islands. Gene diversity was calculated according to Nei [68]. Distances between populations were estimated using haplogroup frequency-based linearized FST[69] as in Arlequin v.3.5 [70]. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was performed using R software and the \u201csmacof\u201d package [71]. Admixture estimates were calculated with the WLSAdmix program [72], which was kindly provided by Dr Jeffrey Long, as in Fregel et al. [38].",
            "The average endogenous DNA content for the Canarian ancient samples is 7.92%, a relatively high value considering the warm and humid environmental conditions of the archipelago (S3 Table). However, endogenous DNA values varied within and between archaeological sites, ranging between 0.02% and 39.0% (IQR = 0.67% - 11.5%). All samples meet the standard aDNA authentication criteria, including observation of DNA fragmentation and damage patterns at both ends of molecules, and low modern DNA contamination rates (Fig 2). Those contamination rates calculated with contamMix are larger than those produced with Schmutzi. One possible reason is that contamMix estimations are more sensitive to low coverage values (S3 Table). For example, sample CAN.033, with a 7.9X mtDNA coverage, has a contamination rate of 10.2% based on contamMix and 1.0% on schmutzi. Schmutzi has been reported to be able to obtain accurate contamination rates for coverage down to \u223c5X [56]. However, in other cases, variable contamination estimations do not seem to be related to low coverage, and other factors may be interfering.",

            "After capture, we obtained complete mtDNA genomes from 48 ancient human remains sampled in 25 different archaeological sites (S3 Table). Our sample set covers the entire archipelago and a time span of 1,200 years (S1 Fig). The average mtDNA depth is ~140X, with a minimum value of 8X (S3 Table). Observed haplogroups agree with previous studies [33,36\u201339,41], indicating the presence of North African (U6), Eurasian (H, J2, T2 and X) and sub-Saharan African lineages (L1 and L3) in the Canarian indigenous population (S2 Fig). As delineated before [36], the majority of haplogroups observed are of Eurasian origin, most with a Mediterranean distribution. This result is expected, as recent aDNA data from North Africa has indicated the presence of Neolithic European lineages as early as the Late Neolithic period (~5,000 BP) [73].",
            "We also obtained complete mtDNA genomes from a set of 18 modern Canarians (S3 Fig;S4 Table). More than 50% of the samples belong to haplogroup H, with a higher diversity of sub-haplogroups than the one observed in the indigenous population. In addition to H1cf and H1e1a, we observe other H1 sub-lineages and other branches, such as H6a1, H3c2 or H43, which are most likely of European origin. Other haplogroups present in the indigenous people are also observed in the modern population, including J2a2d, U6b1a and X3a. In line with previous analyses [27,31], a sub-Saharan African (L3d1b3a) [74] and an Amerindian lineage (A2) [75] are observed in the current population of the Canary Islands. Assuming that our set of 48 ancient genomes is representative of the native population, we performed a rough admixture estimate of 27.8% of maternal lineages in members of the present-day population possessing indigenous origins, while 61.1% would be of European ascription (S3 Fig).",
            "In order to compare our samples to previously published data, we combined the newly generated mtDNA genomes with HVRI data from the Canarian indigenous population (S2 Table;S5 Table) [33,36\u201339]. Given that sample sizes for Lanzarote and Fuerteventura are small and their indigenous populations are considered to be similar based on archaeological data [76], these data sets were pooled together. It is worth mentioning that those samples for which mitochondrial data were generated, using both classical techniques and NGS sequencing (n = 15), produced identical HVRI haplotypes, proving our PCR-based approach generates authentic results (seeS5 Table).",
            "As previously observed, the indigenous populations of the Canary Islands in the past were not homogenous (Table 1;Fig 3). The islands of La Palma and Tenerife show a relatively diverse mtDNA composition (>70%) [33,36,37], while the others show signs of genetic drift and/or diversity reduction events, such as a bottleneck or a founder effect. In La Gomera, mtDNA diversity was 54.2%, due to the high frequency of haplogroup U6b1a [38], while in El Hierro, this value was 2.9%, with the almost complete fixation of H1cf haplogroup in the Punta Azul site [39]. This same result has been recently observed in a genome-wide study of the modern population of the Canary Islands. Concretely, El Hierro and La Gomera showed longer runs of homozygosity when compared to the other islands, which can be interpreted as signatures of genetic isolation and reduced population size [77]. With new data on the indigenous population of Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura (S4 Table), we show that Gran Canaria had high mtDNA diversity, similar to Tenerife and La Palma, while Lanzarote and Fuerteventura had low diversity (51.1%) because of the high frequency of H*(xH1cf, H4a1a) lineages. These findings emphasize that results obtained from the larger islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria should not be extrapolated to the entire archipelago. Estimations of population sizes during pre-colonial times based on archaeological evidence agree with mtDNA results. Populations in Gran Canaria, Tenerife and, to a lesser degree, La Palma, were large and able to sustain relatively high diversity, while Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and El Hierro were almost depopulated at the time of the conquest [78]. In the case of La Gomera, the population size was also reported to be small [79].",

            "By directly comparing the mtDNA types found in the indigenous population of each island, we observe that H4a1e, L3b1a, U5 and U6c haplogroups are present only in the eastern islands (Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura). Differences between eastern and western islands were shown to be significant for the four haplogroups, when all the ancient samples were considered: H4a1 (p= 0.0117), L3b1a (p= 0.0038), U5 (p= 0.0117) and U6c (p= 0.0012). Though also present in the western islands, haplogroups T2c1 (p= 0.0168) and U6a (p= 0.0029) appeared more frequently in the eastern islands. However, these results can be artifacts caused by the high frequency of H1cf in El Hierro and U6b1a in La Gomera. After removing these two populations from the western group, only differences in the distribution of U6c remained significant (p= 0.0332).",
            "In contrast with the heterogeneity we observe in pre-Hispanic times, mtDNA haplogroup frequencies in modern populations of the Canary Islands are homogenous (Fig 3;S6 Table), with the sole exception of La Gomera [27]. The high frequency of haplogroup U6b1a observed in the indigenous population of La Gomera is also detected in its present-day population [38]. However, the same pattern is not observed for El Hierro. In pre-colonial times, H1cf was almost fixated in El Hierro [39], while the frequency of this haplogroup today is 4.6%, not significantly different from the average 2.4% observed in the entire archipelago (p= 0.2364).",
            "In order to determine the admixture pattern at an insular level, we compared modern Canarian samples with their principal parental populations: indigenous people, Iberians, and sub-Saharan Africans (S2 Table). Global admixture estimations using the new mtDNA dataset (Table 2) confirm previous results on the survival of native lineages in the modern population (55.9%). However, we observed that results within islands are variable. When the miscellaneous ancient sample is used as one of the parental populations, indigenous contribution to the modern population ranges from 30.7% in Gran Canaria to 71.4% in La Gomera. However, this approach is not correct, as we know that the indigenous population of the archipelago was heterogeneous and mtDNA frequencies were variable. With our new dataset of 322 HVR samples, we were able to estimate admixture, using aDNA sampled directly from each island. Although sample sizes per sub-population are still low for some islands, we can start providing some insight in interinsular differences regarding indigenous people survival. Indigenous mtDNA contribution estimates are lower when a direct comparison is performed, with values ranging from 0% in El Hierro to 55.5% in La Gomera (Table 2). The extreme result observed in El Hierro is evidently due to the marked difference between the ancient and current people. It is interesting that, when the miscellaneous sample is used, the indigenous contribution increases to 36.2%. This result is reasonable, given that the present-day sample from El Hierro is not significantly different from other islands. This can be explained if we consider that El Hierro was almost depopulated at the time of the European conquest [80]. In fact, it was recounted in the chronicles that the indigenous population of El Hierro was decimated due to razzias (raids for the purpose of capturing slaves) at the time of the Spanish conquest, and was later repopulated with indigenous populations from other islands and European colonizers [81,82].",
            "Admixture results for the modern population of the Canary Islands using the three main parental populations: Iberian Peninsula (IBP), sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the Canarian indigenous population (CIP). Admixture calculations were performed using two approximations: A) we used the whole ancient dataset (combining the ancient samples from all the seven islands) as CIP for calculating admixture estimates for all islands; B) we used each ancient sample to calculate the admixture of its respective island (e.g. to calculate admixture in the modern population of Gran Canaria we exclusively used the ancient samples from Gran Canaria as CIP). Results are shown for: the whole Canary Islands population (CAN) and the seven individual islands (Codes as inTable 1).",
            "To determine if a more specific origin for the Canarian indigenous population could be ascertained, the ancient mtDNA sample was combined with a reference modern DNA database containing samples from the Canary Islands, Europe, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Near East (S2 Table). In the MDS analysis (Fig 4), the ancient sample from El Hierro and the ancient and modern samples from La Gomera act as outliers, due to the high frequency of H1cf and U6b1a, respectively. When the two outliers were removed and all the remaining ancient samples were pooled together, the first dimension differentiates sub-Saharan populations from Eurasian populations, including North Africa and the Canary Islands. The second dimension places Canarian and European/Near Eastern populations on both ends, with North Africans in an intermediate position. The closest North African sample to the Canarian indigenous population in the second dimension is West Sahara. However, the ancient sample is differentiated from all current North African populations and placed closer to modern Canarians. This is due to the fact that haplogroups occurring frequently in the Canarian ancient and current samples (e.g. U6b1a) are not present or appear in low frequencies within the reference populations. This result concurs with later demographic processes reshaping the mtDNA landscape of North Africa, and/or founder effects and isolation in the Canary Islands. It is interesting that, compared to the other islands, the modern populations of Tenerife and Gran Canaria are closer to the European populations. This result is expected, because they each have capital cities of the two Canarian provinces and, thus, have received substantial historical migration from the mainland.",

            "The HVRI has been proven to be of limited value in providing a clear picture of the origin of the indigenous people of the Canary Islands. In order to conduct a better assignment of the geographic origin of the maternal Canarian indigenous lineages, we performed detailed phylogeographic analysis of all the lineages observed in the aDNA dataset (S4 Fig), including those from Rodriguez-Varela et al. [41]. For detailed information on our phylogenetic analysis, seeS2 File.",
            "We observe five different H sub-lineages in the indigenous people of the Canary Islands: H1cf, H1e1a9, H2, H3 and H4a1e. H1cf (S5 Fig) seems to be restricted to both the Canary Islands and Central North Africa, and shows a coalescence age (~3,400 years ago) that is in agreement with a continental origin before the colonization of the islands (S6 Fig). Newly defined haplogroups H1e1a9 (S7 Fig) and H4a1e (S8 Fig) are both restricted to the Canary Islands, with a distribution similar to that observed for U6b1a. However, in this case, H1e1a9 and H4a1e coalescence ages overlap with the human occupation period (S6 Fig) and are compatible with an origin in the islands. The presence of lineages derived of H1e1a and H4a1 in both European Neolithic and the Canary Islands ancient samples corresponds with Eurasian prehistoric intrusions in North Africa [83]. Two samples were classified within basal H2 and H3 haplogroups, preventing further phylogenetic analysis.",
            "Two sublineages of haplogroup J are observed in the indigenous population of the Canary Islands: J1c3 and the newly defined J2a2d1a1. J1c3 is present in Europe, North Africa and the Near East, and more interestingly, in ancient Neolithic samples from Spain and Sardinia (S9 Fig). Although J2a2d1a* has been spotted in Central North Africa, subhaplogroup J2a2d1a1 is exclusive to the Canary Islands and Brazil, the latter representing an area with known historical migrations from the islands (S10 Fig). Accordingly, this new autochthonous Canarian lineage has a coalescence age that overlaps with the indigenous occupation of the islands (S6 Fig).",
            "Phylogenetic analysis of the Canarian T2 sequences places them within T2b and T2c1d, two haplogroups thoroughly observed in Neolithic and Bronze Age sites from Europe. The inclusion of ancient and modern Canarian samples allows us to define four new T2c1d subhaplogroups (S11 Fig). T2c1d3 haplogroup is present in both Tunisia and the Canary Islands. T2c1d1c1 and its two subclades (T2c1d1c1a and T2c1d1c1b) are present in both North Africa and the current population of the eastern Canary Islands. This distribution could be explained by an asymmetrical migration pattern, or, given its absence in the indigenous people, by a higher impact of Moorish slave trade in the eastern islands (S2 File).",
            "We identify several ancient samples within macrohaplogroup L, belonging to L1b1a and the newly defined L3b1a12. Although current mtDNA analysis evidences the presence of Sub-Saharan lineages into North Africa in the Early Holocene [84], Later Stone Age [85], and Early and Late Neolithic [73] samples from North Africa have not showed any mtDNA lineage of sub-Saharan origin. On the other hand, our results imply the presence of L1b and L3b1a in North Africa at least at the time of the colonization of the Canary Islands. Regarding L3b1a12 (S12 Fig), this lineage can also be considered autochthonous of the Canary Islands, with a coalescence age posterior to the proposed colonization date (S6 Fig). Interestingly, this lineage was only present in the eastern islands in ancient times, but has a wider distribution at the present time, suggesting extensive movement of native people after the conquest.",
            "Canarian ancient sequences belonging to X haplogroup are classified within the X3a clade (S13 Fig). This lineage is present both in Europe, the Near East and northeast Africa, as well as in the ancient and current populations of the Canary Islands.",
            "Finally, several U6 sublineages are observed in the indigenous population of the Canary Islands, including U6a1a1 (S14 Fig), U6a7a1 (S15 Fig), U6b1a (S16 Fig) and U6c1 (S17 Fig). U6a1a1, U6a7a1 and U6c1 are present in the Maghreb, southern Europe and the Canary Islands, and are most probably related to prehistoric Mediterranean expansions (S14,S15andS17Figs). As reported before, the Canarian autochthonous U6b1a is also present in regions with recent Canarian migration, including mainland Spain and Cuba (S16 Fig). Given its coalescence age and the oldest calibrated radiocarbon dates from human remains from the Canary Islands (S6 Fig), U6b1a most probably originated in North Africa and later migrated to the Canaries. However, to date, this lineage has not been observed in the continent, indicating the migrations occurred after the colonization of the Canary Islands reshaped the North African mtDNA landscape. Interestingly, one modern sample from Lebanon [86] has been assigned to the U6b1a3 cluster. Although an origin for U6b1a in this region is possible, the fact that the sample belongs to the derived U6b1a3 cluster might indicate that its presence is related to a historical migration to the Lebanon from the Canary Islands [30]. However, additional aDNA data from North Africa and the Near East will be fundamental for unequivocally determining the specific origin of U6b1a.",
            "Our mtDNA results on the indigenous people of the Canary Islands shed light on the prehistory of North Africa. Our data are in agreement with recent aDNA data from Morocco [73] and further evidence of a complex pattern of Mediterranean migrations in North Africa. Archaeological records in the Maghreb support this result, and also suggest further European intrusions during the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age eras [87,88]. Additionally, Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans arrived in the North African region in historical times [89\u201392]. The presence of haplogroups of Mediterranean distribution in the indigenous people of the Canaries demonstrates the impact of these prehistoric and historical migrations in the Berbers and that they were already an admixed population at the time of the indigenous colonization of the islands [93].",
            "In our phylogeographic analysis of complete mtDNA sequences from the Canarian indigenous population, we found lineages that are only observed in Central North Africa and the Canary Islands (H1cf, J2a2d and T2c1d3), while others have a wider distribution including both West and Central North Africa, and, in some cases, Europe and the Near East (U6a1a1, U6a7a1, U6b, X3a, U6c1). These results point to a complex scenario, where different migration waves from a dynamic and evolving North African population reached the islands over time. Every island experienced their own evolutionary path, determined by the environmental conditions and limitations of insularity. Those islands with the capability of sustaining large populations retained variability, while others with more restricted means (La Gomera and probably El Hierro) had to develop cultural practices to avoid inbreeding, like mandatory exogamic practices [79,94].",
            "Although the North African Berber origin is the most widely accepted hypothesis, other lines of research have proposed that certain funerary practices and religious beliefs observed in the indigenous population of the Canary Islands could be linked to Punic-Phoenician influence [95], thus proposing the colonization of the Canary Islands as the result of Phoenicians expanding their control to the Atlantic Ocean. Based on the limits of the territorial occupation of the Atlantic West Africa by Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans, most researchers consider it unlikely that there was a political occupation or economic exploitation of the archipelago [96\u201398]. However, the islands were not unknown to Mediterranean cultures, and Romans possessed the seafaring skills needed to travel to the islands [22]. Some authors think Phoenicians also had the navigational technology required to reach the Canary Islands [99,100], although this idea has been challenged [101]. The first Phoenician aDNA sample published was a complete mtDNA sequence of a child from Carthage dated to the 6thcentury BC [86]. This Carthaginian sample was classified within U5b2c1 haplogroup. This result is interesting, given that U5 was more frequent in the indigenous population of the eastern islands, including the island of Lanzarote, where a Punic-Phoenician influence has been proposed. As U5 haplogroup was not uncommon in Neolithic European samples, and its presence in North Africa might be due to prehistoric migrations, an alterative explanation would be that haplogroup U5 was incorporated into the Berber mtDNA pool before the Carthaginians were established in Tunisia. Recently, Matisoo-Smith et al. [102] published thirteen complete mitogenomes from Punic-Phoenician samples from Lebanon and Sardinia. The only haplogroups in common with the indigenous population of the Canary Islands are H3 and H1e1a, although, in this case, the Phoenician H1e1a sample is classified within the sub-lineage H1e1a10. The lack of overlap between the mtDNA composition of Phoenicians and the Canarian indigenous people disagrees with either a Punic-Phoenician origin for the ancient islanders or sustained contact between the two populations.",
            "Previous genetic analyses of the modern Canarian population detected an asymmetrical distribution of maternal and paternal lineages in the archipelago [31,35]. Our aDNA results confirm the existence of asymmetrical distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in pre-colonial times, with the presence of haplogroups H1e1a9, H4a1e, L3b1a12 and U6c1 only in the eastern islands. However, it is worth mentioning that La Palma, the island with the most anthropological evidence of two migrations waves, does not show any of these lineages. If we consider the presence of H1e1a9, H4a1e, L3b1a12 and U6c1 haplogroups to be the result of further population movements from North Africa to the eastern islands, we could approximate the date based on radiocarbon dates of the sites where the sample was taken. Most sites where these lineages have been observed have radiocarbon dates placed around the 13thcentury, and all except one are from after the 10thcentury. The only site with an older date is Guayadeque; however, we have to take into account that this is a large site, with evidence of human occupation extending until the 14thcenturies AD [103], and the dating was not performed directly on the analyzed sample.",
            "Archaeological data has evidenced significant changes in the productive strategies of some islands around the 11th- 12thcenturies [12,76,104\u2013106]. In fact, recent data indicates probable population growth in Gran Canaria at that time, suggesting the appearance of new settlements associated with an exploitation model that intensified the use of marine resources, the increase in the size of settlements linked to agricultural nuclei, and changes in the production of some craftsmanships [12,107,108]. These changes have been interpreted as part of an endogenous process, as it has been determined that this population growth involved neither significant changes in the structure of human settlements or burials, nor introduced differences in land management or the types of domestic species that were exploited. However, it is also possible to explain those changes as the result of the arrival of new migrants to the island of Gran Canaria. Although it is still under study, there is evidence for transformations in the configuration of some settlements in Lanzarote, between the 8thand 13thcenturies [109]. Again, these modifications could be reflecting changes in the conception of domestic space due to an endogenous process, or associated with the arrival of new colonizers. Archaeological information from Fuerteventura is not abundant enough to determine population size changes that could be related to the arrival of new migrants. Nevertheless, it is clear from the archaeological record that Fuerteventura and Lanzarote maintained frequent contact and shared both cultural and economic elements [76,110]. Future paleogenomic efforts to obtain more complete mtDNA genomes and additional genome-wide data from all seven islands, in combination with proper archaeological contextualization of the genetic data and detailed radiocarbon dating, will be essential for improving our knowledge of the origins and evolution of the indigenous population of the Canary Islands.",

            "Hominins with morphology similar to present-day humans appear in the fossil record across Eurasia between 40,000 and 50,000 y ago. The genetic relationships between these early modern humans and present-day human populations have not been established. We have extracted DNA from a 40,000-y-old anatomically modern human from Tianyuan Cave outside Beijing, China. Using a highly scalable hybridization enrichment strategy, we determined the DNA sequences of the mitochondrial genome, the entire nonrepetitive portion of chromosome 21 (\u223c30 Mbp), and over 3,000 polymorphic sites across the nuclear genome of this individual. The nuclear DNA sequences determined from this early modern human reveal that the Tianyuan individual derived from a population that was ancestral to many present-day Asians and Native Americans but postdated the divergence of Asians from Europeans. They also show that this individual carried proportions of DNA variants derived from archaic humans similar to present-day people in mainland Asia.",
            "Keywords:ancient DNA, human evolution, nuclear capture strategy, paleogenetics",
            "The term \u201cearly modern humans\u201d generally refers to humans who fall within the morphological variation of present-day humans and date to the Middle or Early Upper Paleolithic. The earliest modern humans appear in the Eurasian fossil record about 45,000 y ago, whereas the last remains that tend to be classified as early modern humans are about 25,000 y old (1). Early modern humans may exhibit some archaic features shared with other earlier forms of humans such as Neandertals. Although early modern humans are thus only vaguely defined as a group, their genetic relationship to present-day humans is unclear. Similarly, their relationship to archaic humans is of interest, given that they may have interacted directly with them.",
            "To begin to explore the genetic relationships of early modern humans with present-day humans, we have analyzed a partial human skeleton that was unearthed in 2003, along with abundant late Pleistocene faunal remains, in the Tianyuan Cave near the Zhoukoudian site in northern China, about 50 km southwest of Beijing. The skeleton was radiocarbon-dated to 34,430 \u00b1 510 y before present (BP) (uncalibrated), which corresponds to \u223c40,000 calendar years BP (2). A morphological analysis of the skeleton (3) confirms initial assessments (4) that this individual is a modern human, but suggests that it carries some archaic traits that could indicate gene flow from earlier hominin forms. The Tianyuan skeleton is thus one of a small number of early modern humans more than 30,000 y old discovered across Eurasia (2) and an even smaller number known from East Asia (5).",
            "To evaluate DNA preservation and the degree of modern human contamination in the Tianyuan skeleton, we prepared two DNA extracts from the left femur (TY1301) and two from the right tibia (TY1305) of the human skeleton excavated in Tianyuan Cave (4) using less than 100 mg of bone material per extraction (Table S1). Sequencing of random DNA fragments from DNA libraries constructed from these four extracts revealed that about 0.01\u20130.03% of the DNA in the libraries was of human origin (SI Text, section 1andTable S1). This low percentage of endogenous DNA precludes sequencing of the entire genome of this individual. Thus, we used DNA capture approaches to retrieve the mitochondrial (mt)DNA (6) and nuclear DNA sequences from the Tianyuan individual.",
            "We used a protocol for targeted DNA sequence retrieval that is particularly suited for mtDNA (6) to isolate mtDNA fragments. In total, we sequenced 4,423,607 unique DNA fragments from both ends on the Illumina GAII platform from the four libraries. Of these, 0.1\u20137.7% (Table S1) could be aligned to a human mtDNA reference sequence (7). All four libraries yielded consensus mtDNA sequences that agreed with each other. This is in agreement with the observation of paleontologists that the two bones come from a single individual (2). For estimation of mtDNA contamination and phylogenetic analyses, we used DNA fragments isolated from the femur library that had the highest mtDNA content (Table S1) and yielded an average coverage of 35.6-fold of the mtDNA genome.",
            "When studying modern humans, it is particularly difficult to exclude that DNA from present-day humans might have contaminated the samples or experiments. It has previously been argued (8) that the combination of two observations makes it likely that a DNA library contains a majority of endogenous ancient human DNA: First, that the patterns of DNA degradation, in particular nucleotide misincorporations resulting from deamination of cytosine residues at ends of DNA fragments, indicate that the mtDNA is ancient; and second, that deep sequencing of the mitochondrial genome indicates that the human mtDNA in the library comes from a single individual. We identified 78 distinct DNA fragments that cover three positions where the Tianyuan mtDNA consensus differs from at least 308 of 311 mtDNA genomes from around the world (9). All these fragments carry the consensus base at these positions, indicating that the vast majority [95% confidence interval (CI): 95.3\u2013100%] of the endogenous mtDNA fragments come from a single source (SI Text, section 2). Alignments of the individual mtDNA fragments against the consensus sequence constructed from all fragments reveal C\u2192T and G\u2192A substitution frequencies of between 25 and 30% close to the ends of the DNA fragments (Fig. S1C), an extent of substitution indicative of cytosine deamination not seen in present-day human contamination (8,10). We conclude that the human DNA extracted from the Tianyuan skeleton comes from a single individual and is likely to be endogenous to the skeleton.",
            "We estimated a phylogenetic tree for 311 modern human mtDNAs, the Tianyuan mtDNA, and a complete Neandertal mtDNA (Fig. S2). The Tianyuan mtDNA falls within the variation of present-day human mtDNA. It carries all substitutions that have been used to define a group of related mtDNA sequences\u2014\u201chaplogroup R\u201d\u2014and in addition a deletion of a 9-bp motif (5\u2032-CCCCCTCTA-3\u2032, revised Cambridge reference sequence positions 8,281\u20138,289) as well as a substitution at position 16,189 (Fig. S3A), which together have been used to define a group of related mtDNA sequences, \u201chaplogroup B\u201d (11\u201313), within haplogroup R. In addition, it carries four substitutions (5,348, 5,836, 11,257, 16,293) that are not defining subgroups of haplogroup B (14\u201317). Thus, it is related to the mtDNA that was ancestral to present-day haplogroup B (Fig. 1), which has been estimated to be around 50,000 y old (18) (50. 7 ka BP; 95% CI: 38.1\u201368.3 ka BP). We note that the age of the Tianyuan individual is compatible with this date.",

            "Today, mtDNA of haplogroup B occurs in Native Americans, populations of the Russian Far East, Central Asia, Korea, Taiwan, Melanesia, and Polynesia. It is thus widespread in Asia and America. The fact that an individual who lived in the Beijing area 40,000 y ago carried a mitochondrial genome that is potentially ancestral to mtDNAs in all these areas suggests that there is at least some population continuity from the earliest modern humans in East Asia to present-day populations in these areas. However, although genetic reconstructions of human population histories in Eurasia have relied heavily on mtDNA variation (19\u201321), the extent to which this accurately reflects older population histories in the region is unknown. We therefore proceeded to analyze nuclear DNA sequences of this individual who represents a member of an early population in Asia.",
            "The ability to sequence nuclear DNA sequences from the Tianyuan individual is limited by the fact that no more than 0.03% of the DNA extracted is endogenous to the bone. Previous studies (22\u201324) have shown that hybridization enrichment can be used to obtain nuclear DNA fragments from ancient samples. However, the commercially available hybridization systems used in these studies provide only a limited number of capture probes in each hybridization reaction. Because the enrichment of highly fragmented DNA requires large overlaps between probes, this limits the total size of genomic regions that can be targeted to a few megabases at best. To overcome this limitation, we modified a strategy previously described by Gnirke et al. (25) that uses oligonucleotides synthesized on arrays to construct probe libraries that are then amplified and converted into biotinylated RNA capture probes through in vitro transcription. Our approach differs in that first we use oligonucleotides from arrays with higher probe density (1 million probes per array); second, we exclude most of the linker sequence from oligonucleotide synthesis; third, we combine probe libraries from several arrays into a single \u201csuperprobe library\u201d; and fourth, we use biotinylated DNA instead of RNA probes. This way, we produced a library consisting of 8.7 million different probes tiled at 3-bp intervals across the 29.8 Mbp of all nonrepetitive sequence in chromosome 21 (Fig. S4).",
            "We produced additional DNA extracts and libraries from femur TY1301, this time using uracil DNA glycosylase and endonuclease VIII during library preparation to avoid nucleotide misincorporations induced by deaminated cytosine residues (26). From these libraries as well as the two initial libraries from the femur, we performed two successive enrichments for chromosome 21 fragments (Fig. S5). A total of 789,925 unique DNA fragments was identified that represents 1.75-fold coverage of the targeted regions. Separately, we also enriched for mtDNA by the same approach. This resulted in estimates of the average human mtDNA contamination in these libraries between 0.1% and 3.1% (SI Text, section 3.4). A comparison with shotgun sequencing results for two of the libraries used for capture showed that more than 70% of the total number of target DNA molecules present in the libraries was isolated by the capture procedure (SI Text, section 3.3). Thus, this procedure efficiently captures short molecules in very complex mixtures of DNA.",
            "To investigate the relationship of the Tianyuan individual to present-day populations, we compared it to chromosome 21 sequences from 11 present-day humans from different parts of the world (a San, a Mbuti, a Yoruba, a Mandenka, and a Dinka from Africa, a French and a Sardinian from Europe, a Papuan, a Dai, and a Han from Asia, and a Karitiana from South America) and a Denisovan individual, each sequenced to 24- to 33-fold genomic coverage (27). Denisovans are an extinct group of Asian hominins related to Neandertals (28). In the combined dataset, 86,525 positions variable in at least one individual are of high quality in all 13 individuals.Table 1shows that the Tianyuan individual differs by 21,944\u201323,756 substitutions from the Eurasian individuals, by 30,297\u201335,938 substitutions from the African individuals, and by 43,893 substitutions from the Denisovan individual. Thus, the Tianyuan individual was clearly more similar to present-day humans than to Denisovans, and more similar to present-day Eurasians than to present-day Africans.",
            "Pairwise nucleotide differences among chromosome 21 sequences analyzed",
            "To more accurately gauge how the population from which the Tianyuan individual is derived was related to Eurasian populations, while taking gene flow between populations into account, we used a recent approach (29) that estimates a maximum-likelihood tree of populations and then identifies relationships between populations that are a poor fit to the tree model and that may be due to gene flow. As suggested by the nucleotide differences (Table 1), the maximum-likelihood tree (Fig. S6A) shows that the branch leading to the Tianyuan individual is long, due to its lower sequence quality. However, among Eurasian populations, Tianyuan clearly falls with Asian rather than European populations (bootstrap support 100%). The strongest signal not compatible with a bifurcating tree (Fig. S6B) is an inferred gene-flow event that suggests that 6.7% of chromosome 21 in the Papuan individual is derived from Denisovans, in agreement with previous findings (28,30). When this is taken into account, the Tianyuan individual appears ancestral to all Asian individuals studied (Fig. 2). We note, however, that the relationship of the Tianyuan and Papuan individuals is not resolved (bootstrap support 31%). Further work is necessary to clarify whether this reflects the age of the Tianyuan individual relative to the divergence between modern human populations.",
            "",
            "Maximum-likelihood tree relating the chromosome 21 sequences of the Tianyuan individual, 11 present-day humans, and the Denisovan genome. The most strongly supported gene-flow event is shown in yellow. Bootstrap support for all internal edges is 100% except for the edge putting Tianyuan outside the four Asians, which is 31%. The scale bar shows 10 times the average standard error of the entries in the covariance matrix.",
            "It has been shown that a population related to the Denisovan individual contributed genetic material to the ancestors of present-day Melanesians (28,30), and this has also been suggested to be the case for some mainland Asian populations (31) (but see also ref.27). It is therefore of interest to analyze whether the Tianyuan individual shows evidence of any Denisovan genetic contribution. For chromosome 21, we find that any putative admixture from Denisovans must be smaller than that in present-day Papuans and not larger than in other present-day mainland Asians analyzed (SI Text, section 3.7andFig. S6B). However, because archaic admixture may show systematic differences among chromosomes (27), we decided to analyze additional parts of the Tianyuan genome for traces of archaic admixture. To do this, we identified 1,666 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) where both the Neandertal (32) and Denisovan (27) genomes differ from the genomes of individuals from seven African populations in the Foundation Jean Dausset-Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)-Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH) (33), and 1,800 SNPs where the Denisovan genome differs from the Neandertal as well as the seven Africans (SI Text, section 3.7). We synthesized capture probes for these 3,466 sites and generated additional DNA libraries from the Tianyuan individual. After enrichment and sequencing, we identified 834 and 843 sites, respectively, for which data were available for individuals from the HGDP-CEPH and the Tianyuan individual.Fig. 3shows that all non-African populations share more alleles with the two archaic individuals. Over and above the alleles shared with the Neandertal, Melanesians share additional alleles with the Denisovan, as previously described (27,28,30), whereas the Tianyuan individual falls within the range of present-day Eurasian mainland populations. This indicates that the Tianyuan individual is most similar to the latter populations in carrying a genomic component related to the Neandertal genome, but no Denisovan component is discernable with these analyses (see alsoFig. S7).",
            "",
            "Proportion of alleles shared with the Neandertal and Denisovan genomes for the Tianyuan and present-day individuals. The x axis shows the percent of alleles that match the Neandertal and Denisovan genomes at sites where both of these differ from seven Africans, and the y axis indicates the percent of alleles that match the Denisovan genome where this differs from the Neandertal as well as from the seven Africans.",
            "The DNA hybridization capture strategy described here allows sequencing of large sections (>>1 Mbp) of the nuclear genome from mammalian samples even in the presence of a large excess of microbial DNA, a situation typical of almost all ancient samples outside permafrost regions. This opens the possibility of generating DNA sequences from previously inaccessible ancient samples. We use this capture strategy to analyze an early modern human, the Tianyuan individual, who contains less than 0.03% endogenous DNA.",
            "The results show that early modern humans present in the Beijing area 40,000 y ago were related to the ancestors of many present-day Asians as well as Native Americans. However, they had already diverged from the ancestors of present-day Europeans.",
            "That Europeans and East Asians had diverged by 40,000 y ago is consistent with dates for the first archaeological appearance of modern humans in Europe and also with the upper end of an estimate [23 ka BP (95% CI: 17\u201343 ka BP)] for the divergence of East Asian and European populations from nuclear DNA variation in present-day populations (34). The results also show that the Tianyuan individual did not carry any larger proportion of Neandertal or Denisovan DNA sequences in its genome than present-day people in the region. More analyses of additional early modern humans across Eurasia will further refine our understanding of when and how modern humans spread across Eurasia.",
            "The libraries used for mitochondrial capture and shotgun sequencing were produced from 20 \u03bcL of each extract as described (35) without enzymatic removal of deaminated cytosines (uracils) (Table S1). Both library adapters (P5 and P7) carried a 4-bp \u201cclean-room key\u201d sequence (5\u2032-GTCT-3\u2032) that is used exclusively for ancient DNA (36). In addition, sample-specific barcodes were introduced into both library adaptors during amplification (35), which was performed using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems).",

When this did not result in a genotype call, we considered the two most likely homozygous genotypes and called the most likely one if their difference in Phred score was at least 50. The sites that are variable in 13 individuals were converted to TreeMix (29) input (SI Text, section 3.5). To compute pairwise distances, we restricted the analysis to 86,525 sites where a haploid or diploid genotype was called in all individuals, and not more than one nonreference allele was called across all individuals.

            "Being at the western fringe of Europe, Iberia had a peculiar prehistory and a complex pattern of Neolithization. A few studies, all based on modern populations, reported the presence of DNA of likely African origin in this region, generally concluding it was the result of recent gene flow, probably during the Islamic period. Here, we provide evidence of much older gene flow from Africa to Iberia by sequencing whole genomes from four human remains from northern Portugal and southern Spain dated around 4000 years BP (from the Middle Neolithic to the Bronze Age). We found one of them to carry an unequivocal sub-Saharan mitogenome of most probably West or West-Central African origin, to our knowledge never reported before in prehistoric remains outside Africa. Our analyses of ancient nuclear genomes show small but significant levels of sub-Saharan African affinity in several ancient Iberian samples, which indicates that what we detected was not an occasional individual phenomenon, but an admixture event recognizable at the population level. We interpret this result as evidence of an early migration process from Africa into the Iberian Peninsula through a western route, possibly across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
            "Keywords:palaeogenome, Africa, Iberia, mitochondrial DNA, gene flow, admixture",
            "Modern European populations show a southwest-northeast gradient of African diversity with its maximum in Spain [1,2]. It is unclear if this gradient is the consequence of ancient prehistoric contacts or, instead, if it is owing to African migrations into Europe during historical times. Based on genome-wide data from modern populations, African admixture has been estimated to around the time of the Muslim expansion into Iberia [2,3]. However, analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosomes in modern individuals suggest a much older admixture event, possibly dated around 10 000\u20138000 years before present (yBP), [4\u20136]. One of the strongest pieces of evidence is the existence of mitochondrial haplotypes belonging to the sub-Saharan L macro-haplogroup that form European-specific subclades, suggesting they have evolved locally in Europe [5\u20137].",
            "Ancient DNA (aDNA) is a powerful resource to reconstruct events in demographic history [8\u201310]. Studies of prehistoric human remains from Morocco [11,12] and Spain [13] reported genomic evidence of gene flow from Iberia into Late Neolithic Moroccans around 5000 yBP, but none of these works detected admixture in the opposite direction, i.e. from Africa into Iberia. However, all these studies considered a limited number of captured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which may not be powerful enough to detect limited levels of gene flow that happened long ago. Also, these studies used ancient Maghrebians as the potential source of African admixture, and hence may not be a good proxy if the gene flow had a sub-Saharan origin.",
            "Here we used a combination of shotgun and whole-genome capture (WGC) strategies to generate whole-genome data from four prehistoric human remains (coverage from 0.4\u20134.8\u00d7) and 13 mitogenomes from the Iberian Peninsula, dated well before any historical African presence in Iberia. We found one sample from Andalusia (southern Spain) to carry the sub-Saharan mitochondrial haplogroup L2a1, to our knowledge never observed before in ancient human remains outside Africa. In addition, the analyses of the ancient nuclear genomes revealed an increased similarity between Middle Neolithic/Chalcolithic (MN/ChL) samples from Spain and ancient sub-Saharan remains. To our knowledge, this study reports for the first time, both at nuclear and mitochondrial level, direct evidence of prehistoric northbound gene flow from Africa into Europe, probably following a trans-Mediterranean western route.",
            "We sampled 17 ancient individuals from the Iberian Peninsula, originating from: (i) the Mediterranean area in the south of Spain (four individuals from Cueva del \u00c1ngel, Lucena, C\u00f3rdoba; 37\u00b024\u203222\u2033 N, 4\u00b024\u203259\u2033 W) and (ii) the Atlantic watershed in the north of Portugal (three individuals from Lorga de Dine; 41\u00b052\u203230\u2033 N, 6\u00b055\u203240\u2033 W) and Spain (10 individuals from Galicia). Most samples have been carbon dated to around 3000\u20134500 yBP, covering the Middle Neolithic, the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age (BA) period in Iberia (table\u00a01; electronic supplementary material, table S1 and data S1).",

            "All laboratory steps before polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were carried out in dedicated aDNA facilities at the Universities of Potsdam (Germany) and York (UK). Samples were preferentially taken from teeth and petrous bone, when available, and all remains were decontaminated by physical removal of the surfaces and ultraviolet treatment before extraction. DNA was extracted following the protocols from [14,15]. One Illumina library was built from each sample, either as single or double stranded (following [16] and [17], respectively) depending on their latitude of origin and storage conditions after excavation. Libraries preserving less than 20% of endogenous DNA were subjected to capture enrichment (electronic supplementary material, table S2).",
            "We followed two different strategies for the capture experiments: (i) we used capture on array as described in [18] to recover complete mitochondrial genomes from eight samples; and (ii) we developed an in-solution WGC protocol to recover whole genomes and complete mitogenomes from five ancient samples, includingCOV20126. This protocol is based on homemade probes built from commercial male human DNA (PROMEGA). Similar to [19], the commercial DNA is sonicated to an average fragment size of 100\u2013200 bp and then ligated to biotinylated adapters. The sequence of the adapters is different to that of the Illumina oligos, which prevents amplification or sequencing of the baits after capture. Following WGC, we obtained an enrichment in nuclear sequences ranging from 2 up to 12-fold (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Further details in the electronic supplementary material, document S1.",
            "Libraries LD270 and LD1174 were shotgun sequenced each on one lane of an Illumina HiSeqX platform, using 150 cycles in paired-end (PE) mode. A library from LU339 and the capture products ofCOV20126were sequenced each on a whole flow cell of the Illumina platform NextSeq500 using 76 cycles in single-end (SE) mode. The other four libraries subjected to WGC were pooled and sequenced on the NextSeq500 with 76 cycles and PE mode. Finally, the seven libraries captured on array were pooled and sequenced on a single lane of a HiSeq2500 platform using 76 cycles in SE mode.

            "MapDamage[20] was used to assess the patterns of molecular damage in the mapped reads (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). The level of contamination was estimated based on the presence of secondary variants at haploid sites, i.e. in mtDNA and, in males, on chromosome X (electronic supplementary material, document S1).",
            "Finally, we collected raw read data from published ancient samples and mapped them to the reference following the same pipeline (electronic supplementary material, data S2).",
            "For mtDNA analysis, we mapped the reads to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS,NC_012920; [21]). Variants were called using SamtoolsMpileup[22] at positions covered by at least three reads and having a mapping and base quality more than or equal to 30. All called variants were confirmed by visual inspection using Tablet[23]. Also, inCOV20126, we repeated the analysis after usingpmdtools, which restricts the haplogroup assignment to reads showing the typical aDNA pattern of damage [24]. We used Haplogrep(http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/) to assign the mitochondrial haplogroups (table\u00a01and electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S3).",
            "The biological sex of our ancient samples was determined by comparing the genomic coverage of the X chromosome and of the autosomes [25]. The Y chromosome haplogroup ofCOV20126was determined following [26] (electronic supplementary material, figure S2a and S2b).",
            "We assembled two datasets: (i) an ancient dataset including complete mitogenome sequences from 194 prehistoric samples (17 new mitogenomes from this study), covering most of Europe, the Near East and Africa, and the sequence of a Neanderthal individual (Feld2, [27]) as outgroup; and (ii) a modern dataset including published mitogenomes from 388 individuals with European and African ancestry belonging to the L macro-haplogroup, our ancient sampleCOV20126, and an African individual of the L0 haplogroup as outgroup (electronic supplementary material, data S1). Details about the reconstruction of the calibrated phylogenies with BEAST 2.4.8 [28] can be found in the electronic supplementary material, document S1.",
            "We called the autosomal SNPs included in the Human Origins chip [29] in the ancient samples sequenced at nuclear level. We used GATK-3.0-0pileupfor the base calling. At positions covered by more than one read, one allele was randomly chosen with a probability equal to the base frequency at that position. Then, the chosen alleles were duplicated to form homozygous genotypes. We used PLINK [30] to merge these calls to reference ancient and modern datasets from [31]. Also, we realigned bam files and mapped raw read data from recently published ancient remains [10,11,13,32,33]. We called the variants of the Human Origins chip in these alignments and merged the overlapping positions with our ancient samples and those in [31].",
            "After merging, only ancient samples with more than 15 000 called SNPs were kept for downstream analysis. The final dataset included 269 ancient individuals and 1267 modern individuals from Eurasian, North and South African populations (electronic supplementary material, data S3).",
            "For all population genetic analyses, transitions were removed from the datasets (110 532 SNPs left), as well as SNPs in linkage disequilibrium withr2> 0.2 (79 130 SNPs left). We first performed a principal component analysis (PCA, EIGENSOFT), projecting ancient individuals onto the PC1\u2013PC2 space defined by modern individuals from Eurasia and North Africa, using Procrustes analysis [34]. Model-based clustering of the ancient individuals, together with Eurasian, North and South African populations, was conducted with Admixture[35]. The genotype data were pruned for linkage disequilibrium using PLINK [30] with parameters\u2014indep-pairwise 200 25 0.5 [36], resulting in 85 831 SNPs retained. We tested different numbers of clusters fromK= 2 to 20. The results of 10 iterations per K were combined using CLUMPP [37] and plotted with Distruct[38] (see the electronic supplementary material, figures S4a and S4b).",
            "We used outgroupf3statistics to measure the amount of shared drift between the Eurasian samples in our Human Origins dataset since divergence from an African outgroup. We limited the analysis to samples sharing at least 10 000 SNP. The test was run using qp3Pop from the Admixtoolspackage [29].",
            "D-statistics were used to test for an excess similarity between the ancient Iberian samples and an African source with regard to other ancient samples [39]. To increase the power of the test, we used the whole-genome data of our four Iberian samples and a set of complete ancient genomes mapped to the hg19 reference. All individuals selected for this test have an average genome coverage \u2265 1\u00d7, exceptCOV20126, with a genome coverage \u2248 0.4\u00d7 (electronic supplementary material, data S2 and document S1). We computedD-statistics using the ABBA-BABA tool in ANGSD (version 0.920/0.921) [40]. The last two bases at both ends of the reads were trimmed, and mapping and base quality were set to 30, in order to minimize the possible effects of miscalling and aDNA molecular damage.",
            "A combination of shotgun sequencing and hybridization capture approaches allowed us to recover nuclear genome data for four ancient samples. Two individuals come from northern Portugal, LD270 (4.2\u00d7 average genome coverage) and LD1174 (3.8\u00d7), both14C dated to around 4400 calibrated years before present (cal yBP, Chalcolithic), and two from Cordoba in southern Spain, LU339 (4.8\u00d7) andCOV20126(0.4\u00d7), dated to 4889 \u00b1 68 and 3637 \u00b1 60 cal yBP, respectively (figure\u00a01aandtable\u00a01). We also sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of these individuals and 13 additional ancient human remains from North and South Iberia, also dated to the Chalcolithic (electronic supplementary material, table S1). We could confirm the authenticity of the sequences, based on their deamination rates at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the reads and average read lengths between 50 and 80 bp (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Based on mtDNA, we estimated contamination levels between 0.2 and 3.1% (0.1\u20131.4% when only transversions were considered); based on the X chromosome we estimated a ratio of 2\u20133% of contamination inCOV20126, the only individual analysed at genome level that was identified as a male (table\u00a01and electronic supplementary material, table S1).",

The restriction of the analysis to reads showing typical aDNA molecular damage [24], confirmed the assignation ofCOV20126to haplogroup L2a1 l. We followed PhyloTree(http://www.phylotree.org/) to placeCOV20126in a parsimonious phylogeny of the L2 haplogroup (electronic supplementary material, figure S5a) and confirmed its assignment to L2a1. Within this clade, the polymorphisms 16189C and 16192 T together with 534 T placeCOV20126further down on the tree in subclade L2a1 l, although for a complete assignment to this subcladeCOV20126is missing an A at position 143 and a C at position 195. On the same branch of the tree and differing from L2a1 l by only four substitutions, there is L2a1 k, a haplogroup that perhaps has evolved locally in Europe since 13 000 yBP [5,6]. We did not find exact matches to this ancient sequence in a database of modern haplogroup L mtDNAs (n> 2600 haplotypes). However, in present-day populations haplogroup L2a1 l is most frequent in West/West-Central Africa [41], but also in the Caribbean and USA, as a consequence of the transatlantic slave trade, [42]. Most remarkable, the sub-clade, L2a1l2a, comprising five different haplotypes, occurs only in modern DNA samples from Poland [43]. In addition, there are no members belonging to L2a1 l in present-day samples from North Africa.",

All ancient individuals were projected onto the first two principal components defined by modern genomes (figure\u00a01b). Our Iberian samples cluster together with other Chalcolithic Iberians.COV20126is just slightly shifted on the plot towards samples previously described as carrying a Caucasian component in their genomes (ancient individuals from the Russian Steppes and Late Neolithic and BA samples from central Europe), and shows no obvious increased affinity with Africa.",

AtK= 6, this analysis confirmed the similarity between the ancient Iberian samples and other Middle Neolithic and Chalcolithic individuals from Spain (figure\u00a01c), showing the two well-known major genome components related with Western hunter\u2013gatherers (WHG) and Anatolian farmers. AtK= 7, a minor fraction of a genome component associated with the Caucasian hunter\u2013gatherers (CHG) and Russian Steppes is evident inCOV20126, as well as in two Spanish samples from the same BA period [13,47] (figure\u00a01c; electronic supplementary material, data S3). The presence of this component only inCOV20126, i.e. the most recent individual we analysed in the present study, is in agreement with previous work reporting a late arrival of the Pontic Steppe ancestry into the Iberian gene pool [9,46,48,49].",

In short, clustering analyses do not yield any obvious indication of genomic relationships between Africans andCOV20126, which could corroborate the findings of the mtDNA analysis.",
            "The low coverage of some ancient individuals,COV20126among them, strongly reduced the number of available markers in the previous analysis, and hence our power to detect subtle signals of remote admixture events. Therefore, we decided to use the whole-genome sequences we had generated to formally test for admixture with a sub-Saharan source.",

The null hypothesis was that, in the absence of gene flow from Africa, all ancient Iberian samples should form a single cluster, to the Africans' exclusion. Alternatively, African admixture in Iberia after the Mesolithic period would result in negative values ofD. Thus, we formulatedD-statistics of the formD((Iberian_N/BA, La Bra\u00f1a) African, chimpanzee) (figure\u00a03), where Iberian_N/BA was represented in turn by each of the Early Neolithic, Middle Neolithic and BA samples (electronic supplementary material, data S2) and La Bra\u00f1a is a WHG from Northern Spain, known to have contributed genetically to post-Mesolithic populations in Western Europe [10,13,47,50].",

            "Rather surprisingly, the only positive set ofD-values obtained from these analyses was observed forCOV20126. Most remarkable is that, in contrast with the null hypothesis, we found most of the tests involving the other ancient Iberian genomes to yield negative values ofD(figure\u00a03and Test1A in the electronic supplementary material, table S4), suggesting the presence of a subtle but significant African component. There is a general trend to negativeD-values, with the Spanish Middle Neolithic and Chalcolithic samples showing greater (and statistically significant) similarities with the African genomes, than the Spanish Early Neolithic and Portuguese Middle Neolithic individuals (whoseD-values are insignificant). A similar trend towards negative values ofDwas not observed when we repeated the test with a configuration of the formD((WHG, La Bra\u00f1a) African, chimpanzee) (Test1B in the electronic supplementary material, table S4), neither with a time series of ancient samples from east Europe (WHG and post-Mesolithic samples from Hungary and Romania, Test2 in the electronic supplementary material, table S4). In the latter case,D-values fluctuated around 0, with no visible difference between earlier and later individuals.",

We subsampled its genome and increased the presence of contaminant sequences to similar values of those inCOV20126(0.4\u00d7 of genome coverage and \u2248 2,5% of contamination). When we repeated theD-test, despite such modifications, the low-quality version of esp005's genome was still giving signals of African admixture (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). Thus, it seems the low genome coverage cannot by itself explain the apparent absence of African admixture inCOV20126's nuclear sequences.",

This analysis confirmed that all our four samples have the highest levels of shared genetic history with other Middle and Early Neolithic samples from Central Europe and Spain, and with Basques and Sardinians among modern populations (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). However, we detected differences concerning the WHG component. While the Spanish Mesolithic Chan and La Bra\u00f1a are within the WHG that share the most genetic drift with the Portuguese LD1174 and LD270 (f3= 0.271), they are less related with the samples from southern Spain (f3values around 0.25 for LU339 andCOV20126), which share a higher genetic drift with hunter\u2013gatherers from France and Luxembourg than with the Spanish ones (figure\u00a04).

Middle Neolithic samples from Portugal share more genetic drift with Chan (Mesolithic samples from northwest Spain), than the AndalusianCOV20126and LU339 do. Samples from this study are highlighted in orange (southern Iberia) and blue (northern Iberia). (Online version in colour.)",
            "In this study, we found indisputable evidence of the presence of a mitochondrial sequence of sub-Saharan African origin in a 3600 years-old sample,COV20126, from southern Spain. Considering the absence of any closely related mitogenomes in prehistoric Europe, it is difficult to explain this finding by a process other than cross-Mediterranean gene flow before the BA.",
            "AlthoughCOV20216's nuclear genome showed no obvious traces of African admixture, several other samples from Iberia did; in particular, relatively late samples (from the Middle Neolithic and Chalcolithic) collected along the Mediterranean area and on the Spanish plateau. The increased, significant similarity to sub-Saharan African samples shown by these individuals is not matched, as far as we could test, elsewhere in Europe (figure\u00a03and electronic supplementary material, table S4).",
            "Also, we detected a higher African affinity in the Middle Neolithic Spanish samples than in the Portuguese ones, or in individuals from earlier periods. This fits well with archaeological data, reporting similarities in Neolithic tools and pottery decoration (Almagra and the impressed Oran) between the Andalusian and North African shores [51,52].",
            "Taken together, these findings can be explained by at least one episode of gene flow from Africa to southern Iberia, which apparently did not reach (or had a smaller impact on) the northwest Atlantic fringe. The exact date of this episode is difficult to define with confidence. In principle, if it happened in Middle Neolithic times (i.e. a little more than 3600 years ago, which isCOV20126age), its consequences should be evident in the clustering analysis of samples from that period and geographical area, which was not the case. An alternative possibility is that gene flow may have occurred even earlier in Southern Iberia from a population with Sub-Saharan African features, which left some genetic contribution in the genomes of the people, the local hunter\u2013gatherers, they admixed with. Because hunter\u2013gatherer genomes from Southern Spain are not available yet, the consequences of such gene flow become apparent to us only in samples from Middle Neolithic times, in parallel with the reemergence of the local hunter\u2013gatherer component of ancient European genomes [9,46,47]. This hypothesis implies the existence of some north\u2013south genetic structure in pre-Neolithic Iberia, with hunter\u2013gatherers from the south showing a stronger resemblance with sub-Saharan Africans, and it would account for all findings of the present study, as well as for those of previous studies of modern DNA [1,7]. However, to safely discriminate between the two hypotheses, we would need Mesolithic samples from southern Spain, which are at present unavailable.",
            "Whatever the date of gene flow from Africa might be, the presence of African affinities in several individuals, including a clearly African mitogenome, shows that one or more contacts occurred between prehistoric Iberian populations and a population whose features we can describe as sub-Saharan. Whether that happened in a single episode, or two (accounting for the African affinities in, respectively, Spanish MN/ChL samples, andCOV20126), we cannot tell at present. In both cases, the episode(s) we detected left a small, but not negligible, mark at the population level, contributing to a fraction, if minor, of the Iberian gene pool.",
            "With regards to the lack of this signal in the nuclear genome ofCOV20126, it may be related with his younger age compared to the other samples in theD-statistic test and, possibly, with his geographical origin.COV20126's age (3600 yBP) implies a higher number of generations separating him from the time of the admixture event, which could have further diluted the African component within his genome. Additionally, his geographical proximity to the Mediterranean coast (a major point of arrival of prehistoric migrations [53]), may have increased the presence of DNA variants from different sources inCOV20126's ancestors, in comparison with other BA people from the more isolated northern inland regions (esp005). Also, we cannot exclude that technical reasons related with the capture enrichment could have introduced some bias inCOV20126's genomic data. The commercial DNA we used to build the probes comes from anonymous donors and the manufacturer does not provide information about their geographical origin. If most of this DNA is of European ancestry, it may have favoured the capture of European-like, rather than African-like, sequences inCOV20126's genome.",
            "Finally, our study highlights the informative value of mtDNA as a marker of demographic events, which may be difficult to recognize at the genomic level. Indeed, in the long run, recombination is expected to blur the signals of past admixture events, which may instead be preserved in non-recombining DNA fragments (even though the latter are subjected to a stronger impact of genetic drift). Also, these results show that genetic population structure is often complex, and hence broad generalizations about vast territories or long periods of time are unwarranted, if not adequately supported by detailed geographical and archaeological data. Particularly, in the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish plateau and the Cantabrian Mountains seem to have played a major role, reducing the possibility of ancient contacts between the Atlantic and Mediterranean watersheds.",

            "Because of the time and cost associated with Sanger sequencing of complete human mtDNA genomes, practically all evolutionary studies have screened samples first to define haplogroups and then either selected a few samples from each haplogroup, or many samples from a particular haplogroup of interest, for complete mtDNA genome sequencing. Such biased sampling precludes many analyses of interest. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing platforms to generate, rapidly and inexpensively, 109 complete mtDNA genome sequences from random samples of individuals from three Filipino groups, including one Negrito group, the Mamanwa. We obtained on average \u223c55-fold coverage per sequence, with <1% missing data per sequence. Various analyses attest to the accuracy of the sequences, including comparison to sequences of the first hypervariable segment of the control region generated by Sanger sequencing; patterns of nucleotide substitution and the distribution of polymorphic sites across the genome; and the observed haplogroups. Bayesian skyline plots of population size change through time indicate similar patterns for all three Filipino groups, but sharply contrast with such plots previously constructed from biased sampling of complete mtDNA genomes, as well as with an artificially constructed sample of sequences that mimics the biased sampling. Our results clearly demonstrate that the high-throughput sequencing platforms are the methodology of choice for generating complete mtDNA genome sequences.",
            "The increasing availability of complete mtDNA genome sequences from humans has greatly refined the human mtDNA phylogenetic tree and provided new insights into the phylogeography of particular haplogroups (Barnabas et al. 2006;Torroni et al. 2006;Abu-Amero et al. 2007;Derenko et al. 2007;Gonder et al. 2007;Fagundes et al. 2008;Soares et al. 2008;Perego et al. 2009). Such studies typically try to make inferences about population history based on the age of haplogroups (estimated from the number of mutations that have accumulated among mtDNA lineages belonging to the haplogroup) and their geographic distribution. However, making demographic inferences about populations (such as population size changes, population divergence times, migration/admixture events, etc.) from phylogeographic studies is problematic because different phylogenies can arise under the same demographic history, and vice versa (Nielsen and Beaumont 2009). Some studies equate ages of haplogroups with ages of populations, even though a haplogroup that arose a long time ago may have been introduced into a population only recently. Moreover, the method commonly employed to estimate the age of mtDNA haplogroups, namely, the \u201c\u03c1\u201d statistic, has been shown to often give misleading results for simulated data (Cox 2008).",
            "Methods do exist for making demographic inferences from molecular genetic data (Drummond et al. 2002;Hey and Nielsen 2004), but a key requirement of such methods is that the genetic data should be from a random sample of individuals from the population. However, because of the expense and time needed to sequence complete mtDNA genomes with Sanger sequencing technology, previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences have generally either first screened samples by sequencing hypervariable segments of the mtDNA control region and/or genotyping coding region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to classify haplogroups and then selecting one or two samples from each haplogroup for complete mtDNA genome sequencing, or have sequenced many samples from one particular haplogroup of interest in order to investigate the phylogeography of that haplogroup. Such sampling is biased and thus not suitable for demographic inference with existing methods.",
            "Recently, methods have been developed for high-throughput, low-cost sequencing of many complete mtDNA genomes, using a parallel tagged sequencing approach and high-throughput (HT) sequencing platforms (Meyer et al. 2007,2008b). Here, we have applied this approach and obtained 109 complete mtDNA genome sequences from random samples of individuals from three ethnolinguistic groups from the Philippines. Various analyses attest to the accuracy of the sequences generated by the high-throughput approach. Moreover, there are striking differences between Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) of population size change through time constructed for our random samples of mtDNA genome sequences and previous such analyses based on biased samples (Atkinson et al. 2008), and we show that biased sampling can produce similar differences. Our results illustrate the value of random sampling of complete mtDNA genome sequences that can be obtained with the HT platforms and demonstrate that large-scale samples of complete mtDNA genome sequences can be obtained rapidly and efficiently with the HT platforms.",
            "The samples for this study come from three Filipino groups and include 26 Surigaonons, 44 Manobo, and 39 Mamanwa (a Negrito group). All samples were initially prepared for sequencing on the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) GS and GS FLX (hereafter referred to as GS/FLX) platforms, and sequences were obtained for 92 samples. For these, 95% of the resulting reads were assigned to tags, and 83.7% of the untagged reads mapped to the rCRS, with an average length of 222.4 bp. Any nucleotide position in a sequence with less than twofold coverage was automatically called an N, to denote missing data; our goal was to limit the number of such positions to <1% of the sequence for each individual. However, even though 113,045 reads were obtained in total with the GS/FLX, some individuals still did not have sufficient coverage. Furthermore, we observed numerous inconsistencies in homopolymer regions. Homopolymer regions are known to pose a problem with the GS/FLX sequencing technology as the exact number of bases in a run of three or more identical bases cannot be determined because of inaccuracy in the light signal intensity (Green et al. 2008).",
            "Because of the abovementioned issues with the GS/FLX data, we switched to the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform (hereafter referred to as GAII), since it has a much higher throughput and does not have problems sequencing homopolymers. Two GS/FLX pools were converted into GAII libraries and sequenced with the GAII. One pool was sequenced on one lane of the GAII with 51 cycles, with sequences read in one direction only. A total of 4,486,376 reads were obtained, of which 67% of reads were correctly tagged and 70% of the untagged reads mapped to the rCRS. The other pool was also sequenced on one lane with 51 cycles, except sequences were read in both directions. A total of 7,579,656 reads were obtained, of which 54% of the reads were correctly tagged and 43% of sequences mapped to the rCRS. The percentage of GAII reads that were correctly tagged and mapped is thus lower than that for the GS/FLX platform, which is to be expected since quality filtering was used before untagging and mapping for the GS/FLX data as described previously (Green et al. 2008) but not for the GAII data.",
            "In order to call the base at a nucleotide position, we required a minimum of two reads for that position that would then have to agree. For positions with more than two reads, a scoring system (implemented in the MIA assembler) was used in which a consensus (majority) nucleotide was assigned to each position based on all of the reads covering that position from that sample. Reads that matched the consensus nucleotide received a score of +200, while reads that did not match the consensus nucleotide received a score of \u2212600. These scores were then summed, and if the total score was less than 0, an N was assigned to that position. For the purposes of further analysis, sequences were required to have not more than 165 Ns (i.e., <1% missing data). In actuality, the number of Ns per sequence (Supplemental Table S2) ranged from 0 to 113, with an average of 9.9 Ns (i.e., 0.06% missing data) per sequence. The average coverage for the 109 sequences in the final data set was 54.6 (range 9\u2013114), with average minimum coverage of 15.0 (range 2\u201338) and average maximum coverage of 91.4 (range 24\u2013163), as shown inFigure 1and Supplemental Table S2.

It should be noted that only rarely did a sequence in this study match the sequence for the assigned haplogroup exactly, so sequences were assigned to the closest haplogroup for which the sequence contained all mutations that define the haplogroup. Interestingly, many of the new lineages within a haplogroup show population specificity. For example, sequences from all three populations were assigned to haplogroup E1a1a1 (Fig. 4). However, only one Mamanwa sequence actually matched haplogroup E1a1a1 exactly. The other sequences had additional mutations that defined five new lineages within haplogroup E1a1a1: three were found exclusively in nine Manobo, one was found exclusively in four Mamanwa, and one (with two sub-branches) was found exclusively in three Surigaonon. Thus, even though haplogroup E1a1a1 is found in all three populations, the novel lineages within this haplogroup are completely population-specific.

However, we found two novel haplogroups, designated provisionally here as M* and N*. Sequences assigned to haplogroup M* (Fig. 4) share some mutations with haplogroup M4, but do not have the basal mutation (12007) defining that haplogroup; therefore, the sequences were not assigned to M4. These M* sequences were observed in two Mamanwa and one Surigaonon. Haplogroup N* branches directly from the base of macrohaplogroup N (Fig. 5) and was observed in one Manobo and, strikingly, 14 Mamanwa. This novel N* haplogroup thus accounts for 36% of Mamanwa mtDNA sequences.",
            "In order to estimate the divergence time of the novel M* and N* haplogroups, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis in BEAST. The topology for macrohaplogroup N (Fig. 5) involves a trifurcation leading to haplogroups N*, Y2a, and R, and different runs in BEAST gave different branching orders for these three branches. However, the Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests in PAUP* (Kishino and Hasegawa 1989;Shimodaira and Hasegawa 2001) indicate that there are no significant differences among all possible topologies for these three branches. The resulting dates for the divergence of N* are from 55,000 to 60,000 yr ago, with a 95% HPD (the lower and upper bound of the 95% highest posterior density interval) range of \u223c44,000\u201372,500 yr ago. The age of the divergence of the M* haplogroup was similarly estimated from the age of macrohaplogroup M to be 47,862 yr ago (95% HPD = 39,907\u201359,236 yr). The analysis with a normally distributed prior for the mutation rate and the root of the tree resulted in an estimated mutation rate of 1.637 \u00d7 10\u22128(95% HPD = 9.9 \u00d7 10\u22129\u20132.41 \u00d7 10\u22128), similar to previous estimates (Atkinson et al. 2008). In this analysis, the root of the tree was estimated to be 150,277 yr old (95% HPD = 90,716\u2013217,514), in accordance with previous estimates (Endicott et al. 2009).",
            "A strategy that is frequently used to select samples for complete mtDNA genome sequencing is to first sequence HV1, and then select individuals with different HV1 sequences for complete mtDNA genome sequencing (Derenko et al. 2007;Friedlaender et al. 2007). The underlying assumption is that individuals with identical HV1 sequences will also have identical, or nearly identical, coding region sequences. To investigate this assumption, we plotted the number of differences in HV1 sequences versus the number of differences in the coding sequences between each pair of individuals (Fig. 6). Of the pairwise comparisons with no differences in the HV1 sequences, 62.5% of these had one or more differences in the coding region, up to a maximum of 11 differences (Fig. 6). Thus, there can be appreciable coding region variation among individuals with identical HV1 sequences.",

The results of this analysis are depicted as a plot of population size change throughout time, termed a Bayesian skyline plot (BSP). The BSPs for the Mamanwas, Manobos, and Surigaonons are generally similar (Fig. 7A\u2013C), and indicate population growth from 50 thousand yr ago (kya) until \u223c30\u201335 kya, followed by population stasis until \u223c6\u20138 kya, at which point population size decreases. The Surigaonons differ from the other groups in showing another signal of population growth, beginning \u223c2\u20133 kya.

            "The BPSs for these three Filipino groups differ markedly from those for other human populations that were also based on complete mtDNA genome sequences, and which tend to show strong signals of population growth throughout the past 50,000 yr or so (Atkinson et al. 2008). A possible reason for this discrepancy is that previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences suffer from biased sampling, as described above. To investigate if such biased sampling could influence the BSP analysis, we mimicked this sort of sampling by selecting 28 sequences, each from a different haplogroup (or lineage within a haplogroup) from our data and carrying out the BSP analysis. The resulting BSP (Fig. 7D) differs dramatically from the BSPs for the individual Filipino populations (Fig. 7A\u2013C): there is not only a much stronger signal of initial population growth extending from 50 kya to 35 kya, but another signal of growth beginning around 10 kya and no subsequent signal of population decrease. Moreover, the current estimated effective population size for the biased sample is about 40,000, which is 10\u2013100 times that of the corresponding estimates for the individual populations. Thus, biased sampling can give spurious signals of population growth and incorrect estimates of effective population size in the BSP analysis.",
            "We have used HT sequencing platforms to generate complete mtDNA genome sequences rapidly and efficiently. Although we began the study with the GS FLX platform, we switched to the Illumina GA platform as it provides higher coverage and fewer problems with sequences in homopolymer regions. Ongoing improvements in HT sequencing technologies will undoubtedly increase throughput and sequence accuracy and lower costs. A potential concern with HT platforms is that the error rate per base pair is much higher than with traditional Sanger sequencing (Bentley et al. 2008;Johnson and Slatkin 2008). However, because of the much higher coverage per position obtained with the HT platforms (an average of \u223c55-fold in this study), the accuracy of the resulting sequences is expected to be higher than that for sequences obtained via Sanger sequencing. This was borne out in our study; a comparison of the HV1 sequences obtained via Sanger sequencing versus the HT platforms revealed five discrepancies in 109 individuals (thus, the concordance rate = 99.99%), all of which could be attributed to problems with the base-calling software for the Sanger sequencing.",
            "With the average of \u223c55-fold coverage obtained in this study, no sequence had more than 1% missing data, and on average each sequence had only 0.06% missing data. This level of missing data does not influence any of the analyses carried out here, such as haplogroup assignment, diversity statistics, BEAST and BSP analyses, and the like. However, it is possible that for other applications, such as in forensic casework or disease studies, even less missing data would be desirable. This can readily be achieved by increasing the amount of coverage; for example, sequencing just one sample on one lane of the Illumina GA platform can produce up to 16,000-fold coverage of the mtDNA genome (He et al. 2010). However, because of heteroplasmy in mtDNA genomes (Li et al. 2010), some Ns will always be present.",
            "There are two potential limitations of the approach used here to generate complete mtDNA genome sequences. The first is the use of long-range PCR products as the sequencing template, which requires high-quality DNA. However, capture-based methods can be used to generate sequencing libraries enriched for mtDNA sequences (He et al. 2010), even from low-quality DNA. The second potential limitation is the higher error rate per base pair, as discussed above. Although increasing coverage will in general result in more accurate sequences, there are other steps that should be taken to ensure accurate sequences, especially when coverage happens to be low; these include requiring reads from both strands, as discussed in more detail elsewhere (Li et al. 2010).",
            "A further advantage of the HT platforms is that they enable unbiased, population-based sequencing of complete mtDNA genomes, as compared to the biased sampling that characterizes practically all previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences. In sum, these advantages clearly establish HT platforms as the methodology of choice for generating complete mtDNA genome sequences.",
            "Overall, the patterns of mtDNA variation revealed in this study are similar to those observed in previous studies of complete mtDNA genome sequences (Ingman and Gyllensten 2001;Kivisild et al. 2006;Pereira et al. 2009). In particular, we observed a significant excess of variable positions in the control region (Fig. 2), which can be attributed to weaker functional constraints, as it is the major noncoding region of the mtDNA genome. There was also a significant deficiency of variable positions in the 16S rRNA and tRNA genes (Fig. 4), consistent with the view that the mitochondrial rRNA and tRNA genes are subject to strong functional constraints and hence exhibit reduced variation. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio was quite high (Table 2); observing these familiar patterns in the HT-generated sequences further enhances confidence in the accuracy of these sequences.",
            "There were a total of 77 nonsynonymous polymorphisms among the 13 protein-coding genes (Table 2). Of particular interest is the significant excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms (relative to the other mtDNA protein-coding genes) in theMT-ATP6gene (Table 2). Previously, an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in theMT-ATP6gene was observed in Siberian populations, and was hypothesized to reflect positive selection for cold adaptation (Mishmar et al. 2003). Subsequent analyses cast doubt on this interpretation, suggesting instead that flaws in the statistical analyses (Kivisild et al. 2006) and/or relaxation of functional constraints (Ingman and Gyllensten 2007) were better explanations for the observed variation inMT-ATP6. While more sophisticated analyses would be required to investigate any putative signal of selection, our observation of an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms inMT-ATP6in Filipino populations further argues against the cold adaptation hypothesis and in favor of relaxation of functional constraints (Ingman and Gyllensten 2007).",
            "Because of the cost and time associated with the traditional Sanger sequencing approach, practically all previous studies of complete human mtDNA genome sequences have been forced to rely on a biased sampling approach. That is, mtDNA variation is first assayed in samples of interest by some other method (typically, obtaining HV1 sequences), and then a limited set of samples (typically, either one from each haplogroup, or several samples from one haplogroup of particular interest) is selected for complete mtDNA genome sequencing. The limitation of this approach is shown by the fact that individuals with identical HV1 sequences can harbor appreciable coding sequence variation (Fig. 6). Thus, a significant advantage of the HT platforms is that they permit unbiased, population-based sampling of complete mtDNA genome sequences.",
            "The importance of such unbiased sampling is amply demonstrated in the BSP analyses of population size changes through time (Fig. 7). Previously, BSP analyses of complete mtDNA genome sequences, obtained via biased sampling, indicated a general pattern of overall population growth that varied in intensity across geographic regions (Atkinson et al. 2008). The BSPs for each of the three individual Filipino populations differ dramatically from this overall pattern, and instead indicate an initial phase of moderate population growth, followed by a long period of constant population size, and then a decline in population size starting 6\u20138 kya (Fig. 7A\u2013C). In contrast, the BSP for an artificially constructed biased sample (Fig. 7D) differs from those for the individual populations and strongly resembles previously published BPSs (Atkinson et al. 2008). Moreover, the final estimate of effective population size is 10\u2013100 times larger for the biased than for the unbiased samples. Thus, biased sampling can have a dramatic impact on this type of demographic analysis, and the conclusions of previous BSP analyses (Atkinson et al. 2008) should be viewed with caution.",
            "The complete mtDNA genome sequences provide new insights into the genetic history and relationships of these three Filipino groups. Of particular interest are the Mamanwa, as they are a Negrito group. Mainly because of their physical characteristics (including short stature, frizzy hair, and dark skin pigmentation), it is generally thought that Filipino Negrito groups are descended from a separate, early migration from Africa to Asia (Omoto 1984;Bellwood 1997;Hill et al. 2006;Thangaraj et al. 2006). However, there is very little in the way of available genetic data to address this issue. In fact, a recent study of 50,000 autosomal SNP data in Asian populations concluded that Filipino Negrito and non-Negrito groups are descended from the same single primary wave of colonization to East Asia (Abdulla et al. 2009).",
            "The complete mtDNA genome sequences reveal that the Mamanwa possess a novel haplogroup, designated here as N*, that branches from the base of the macrohaplogroup N phylogeny. This haplogroup is at high frequency (36%) in the Mamanwa but absent or nearly so in the other two Filipino groups (Fig. 3;Table 4). The estimated divergence time of this haplogroup is \u223c55,000\u201360,000 yr ago, implying that the ancestors of the Mamanwa may have become isolated from the ancestors of the other Filipino groups at about this time. These results may seem at variance with the 50,000 SNP data, which does not indicate a separate history of Negrito and non-Negrito Filipino groups (Abdulla et al. 2009). However, a possible scenario that reconciles the mtDNA genome sequences with the 50,000 autosomal SNP data involves would-be early isolation of the ancestors of Negrito groups from non-Negrito groups, followed by more recent gene flow from non-Negrito groups into Negrito groups, for which there is evidence in both the mtDNA data (as shown by the \u223c60% frequency of mtDNA haplogroups in the Mamanwa that are characteristic of other southeast Asian groups) and the 50,000 SNP data (Abdulla et al. 2009), as well as in Y-chromosome data (Delfin et al. 2010). We are currently obtaining additional data and exploring other analyses to investigate this further. But in any event, the results of this study amply demonstrate the utility and validity of HT platforms for rapid and efficient sequencing of complete human mtDNA genomes, in particular, for providing the random samples of mtDNA genome sequences needed for demographic analyses.",

MinElute spin columns (QIAGEN) were used to purify the nebulized DNA, which was then eluted in 20 \u03bcL of elution buffer.

To select a model of nucleotide substitution, PAUP* portable version 4.0d105 (Swofford 2003) was used to generate likelihood scores of different competing models, and MODELTEST version 3.7 (Posada and Crandall 1998) was used to choose the best-fit model. A Bayes factor computed via importance sampling (Newton et al. 1994) indicated that the strict molecular clock could not be rejected and was therefore used for the analysis.

            "The evolution and development of human mortuary behaviors is of enormous cultural significance. Here we report a richly-decorated young infant burial (AVH-1) from Arma Veirana (Liguria, northwestern Italy) that is directly dated to 10,211\u20139910\u00a0cal BP (95.4% probability), placing it within the early Holocene and therefore attributable to the early Mesolithic, a cultural period from which well-documented burials are exceedingly rare. Virtual dental histology, proteomics, and aDNA indicate that the infant was a 40\u201350\u00a0days old female. Associated artifacts indicate significant material and emotional investment in the child\u2019s interment. The detailed biological profile of AVH-1 establishes the child as the earliest European near-neonate documented to be female. The Arma Veirana burial thus provides insight into sex/gender-based social status, funerary treatment, and the attribution of personhood to the youngest individuals among prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups and adds substantially to the scant data on mortuary practices from an important period in prehistory shortly following the end of the last Ice Age.",
            "Subject terms:Anthropology, Archaeology",
            "Mortuary practices offer a window into the worldviews and social structure of past societies. Ethnographically, many cultures have delayed attribution of personhood to young children, holding them in a liminal state of humanity1\u20134. Thus, child funerary treatment provides important insights into who was considered a person and thereby afforded the attributes of an individual self, moral agency, and eligibility for group membership. Indeed, significant discussion persists concerning the recognition of infant personhood among prehistoric peoples5\u20137. Here we report the burial of a young infant in Liguria (northwestern Italy)\u2014Arma Veirana Hominin 1 (AVH-1; nicknamed \u201cNeve\u201d), directly dated to the early Holocene. In Europe, the onset of the Holocene (at 11,700\u00a0cal BP) broadly coincided with the early Mesolithic, a cultural period likely to have catalyzed important social changes as humans adapted to significant environmental shifts following the end of the last Ice Age8,9. Burials from the early Mesolithic are exceedingly rare or minimally documented10\u201314, and AVH-1 contributes essential data from this key period of prehistory. Significantly, AVH-1 represents the earliest female near-neonate interment documented in Eurasia and provides novel insights into how age and sex/gender influenced the construction of personhood among prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies.",
            "Arma Veirana is located within the Ligurian pre-Alps (Fig.1) approximately 15\u00a0km northwest of the town of Albenga (44\u00b08\u203245.402\u2033N, 8\u00b04\u203218.85E). The cave is situated on the northside of the steep-sided Val Neva within a marble cliff-face at an elevation of 451\u00a0m above sea level. Arma Veirana preserves deposits of late Pleistocene (with Mousterian and late Epigravettian cultural horizons) and early Holocene age. The Supplementary Information includes additional details on site location, stratigraphy, and geoarchaeology, along with site plan maps and the history of excavation. In 2017 and 2018, in situ skeletal remains (TableS8) and associated artifacts were recovered within a 15\u00a0cm deep oval pit (<\u2009800 cm2in area) cut into the underlying late Epigravettian deposit (Figs.2, S9, S10).

            "An inventory of skeletal remains is provided in TableS9and the 3D coordinates for the plotted elements are included in Supplementary data file 1. The bony remains of the AVH-1 infant are heavily damaged due to surface trampling, water erosion, or chemical alteration. The shallow depth of the burial pit relative to the modern cave floor likely resulted in compression and fragmentation of much of the skeleton. Most of the mid-abdominal region of the skeleton is missing, including the caudal aspect of the thorax, lumbar region, and pelvis. Portions of the lower limb shaft fragments are positioned close to the likely anatomical position of the burial pose (Fig.2) but are largely featureless and at least partly fossilized and concreted. Increased mineralization of these lower limb elements suggests some increased water movement through this portion of the burial pit.",
            "Among the postcranial remains, the right humerus [Plotted Find (PF) #3855] and right scapula (PF#9245) are the most complete elements and their close association indicates that they were in\u00a0approximate anatomical articulation with one another. Their positioning relative to the apparently articulated shell beads and pendants suggest little movement and likely represent the original location of the shoulder at the time of burial. A portion of the right upper thorax was mostly intact and in approximate anatomical position. Several ribs are preserved but they were exceptionally fragile and were heavily fragmented during the process of excavation; however, their original positioning is captured in the photogrammetric model (Fig.2). The thorax location is consistent with the interpretation that the right shoulder is in its original in situ context at the time of interment.",
            "Although crushed, much of the neurocranium is present, with most of the vault portions of the cranial base collected within a single block (Plotted Find #9131) along with disarticulated right (PF#4631) and left (PF#6969) frontal bones. Isolated and developmentally-unfused components of the occipital bone were collected separately (right pars lateralis PF#9241; left pars lateralis PF#6288).

Accentuated lines in prenatal enamel (Fig.3B) also reveal stress episodes affecting the fetus or mother at approximately 47 and 28\u00a0days before birth. Stable isotopes of collagen (\u03b413C and \u03b415N; TableS7)\u2014possibly not yet affected by breastfeeding signals18,19\u2014suggest a terrestrial diet for the mother of AVH-1 similar to late Upper Palaeolithic individuals from the area20,21. Proteomic analysis (Fig.4A) demonstrates a lack of AMELY protein and therefore likely attribution to female sex22,23, a result that is confirmed by a count of nuclear DNA fragments that align with the X chromosome and autosomes (Fig.4B). The mtDNA molecular age AVH-1 is estimated at 9,774\u00a0years BP (95% highest posterior density: 1,853\u201316,662), similar to the radiocarbon age. AVH-1\u2019s mtDNA haplogroup is U5b2b and it nests within a clade of late Pleistocene and early Holocene individuals from central and western Europe (Fig.S13).",

A line of shell beads and three pendants was recovered in situ over the right shoulder and upper thoracic region (Fig.2), suggesting they were sewn onto a blanket or hood. Over 20 of theC. rusticabeads covered the abdominal region (Fig.2), possibly reflecting a beaded vestment or other item skirting the waist and torso. In addition to the beads closely associated with the skeleton, 27C. rusticabeads, oneTurritellasp., and oneGlycymerispendant come from pit fill or disturbed contexts nearby. Most shell beads bear significant wear, implying a lengthy use-life, and were probably not made originally for funerary purposes; rather, the infant likely received beads initially worn by other individuals. Regardless, they represent significant labor. Preliminary experiments estimate manufacture of all the ornaments required 8\u201311 person hours, not including time needed to collect shells and sew the beads onto a garment.",

Surface modifications are consistent with ornamental use (Figs. S14, S15). A gray flint laminar flake with marginal, direct retouch (PF#4587) was collected near the cranium and other than the ornaments, is the artifact in closest spatial relationship to the child (Fig.S16). A fragmentary Sauveterrian point, common in the early Mesolithic24, but also occasionally found in the local Epigravettian25, comes from the top of the pit fill (Fig.S17). Five pieces of ochre and 19 flint and radiolarite debitage pieces were also recovered in pit fill (TableS13). Highly fragmented faunal remains of large and medium-sized artiodactyls, birds, and unidentifiable mammal bones (Tables S14 and S15) were recovered in the burial fill and adjacent sediments (see Supplementary Results).",
            "Though the shell ornaments were clearly worn or otherwise covered the body, there is uncertainty as to whether the other artifacts were buried as grave goods or derive from earlier deposits into which the pit was dug and then refilled. Radiocarbon dates from charcoal and faunal fragments indicate dates of 15,000 \u2013 16,000 calBP for the fill contents (see TableS8and Fig.S11), suggesting an Upper Paleolithic (Late Epigravettian) deposit as the probable substrate into which the burial was dug. Thus, many of the lithics probably derive from the deposits underlying the burial. Given its close spatial relationship, the gray flint laminar flake is the most likely to be truly associated with the skeletal remains. The Sauveterrian point is the piece closest to being a diagnostic Mesolithic artifact; however, it was recovered from sieved material removed from a higher elevation within the burial fill. See further commentary on the lithics in the Supplementary Results.",
            "The abundance of ornamental artifacts associated with AVH-1\u2019s single, intentional burial suggests that at least some early Mesolithic groups attributed personhood to near-neonatal girls. Given the dearth of early Mesolithic samples in general, and infants in particular, it is difficult to generalize the results to other regions of Europe at the onset of the Holocene. However, the interment of female neonates and infants is demonstrated at later Mesolithic and early Neolithic sites such as Lepenski Vir in the Danube Gorges. Work at Lepenski Vir26,27on a sample of 40 young infants has included DNA-based sex identification28and shown that young female were buried in similar frequencies to their male counterparts with no strong pattern differentiating sexes on the basis of spatial distribution or grave goods (e.g., beads).",
            "Unfortunately, for most Mesolithic and Neolithic sites, exact age and sex data are unavailable for the infant samples, leaving much to be understood about how these variables intersect with the construction of personhood. At least some southern European sites preserving the later Mesolithic and Neolithic have been argued to show that young children were often treated similarly to adults in terms of burial rites29, suggesting a general attribution of personhood to young individuals. The relatively large later Mesolithic cemeteries of northern Europe also included significant numbers of child inhumations14,30. In some late Mesolithic cases, young infants (<\u20091\u00a0year of age) were provided apparently symbolic treatments, such as seen with the perinatal child interred with (presumably) its mother at Vedbaek in Denmark. The young Vedbaek child was laid upon a swan\u2019s wing and covered in ochre31, suggesting some degree of at least lineage-imparted social status. However, there is considerable spatial and temporal variation in infant funerary treatment across the late Mesolithic of northern Europe14,30. Children at sites such as Skateholm in Sweden who were interred separately from adults were mostly buried without grave artifacts32. The well-preserved child (<\u20096\u00a0months of age) from the site of Gro\u00df Fredenwalde in Germany dated to approximately 8400 calBP33is likely to provide important insights (especially when a full biological profile has been completed) by pushing back the northern European infant record earlier into the Mesolithic.",
            "Though infant burials are known from earlier (Middle and Upper Paleolithic and early Mesolithic) contexts in Europe and broader Eurasia6,7,10\u201313, most are from old excavations or otherwise minimally documented. Biological profiles including exact age-at-death and sex are thus unavailable in nearly all cases. A pair of neonates dated to 27,000\u00a0cal BP at the Gravettian site of Krems-Wachtberg34is an important exception, shown to comprise male monozygotic twins by the analysis of ancient DNA35. However, a <\u20096\u00a0week old DNA-confirmed female infant interred with grave goods from Upper Sun River in Eastern Beringea (11,500\u00a0cal BP) illustrates that mortuary treatment of baby girls similar to that observed at Arma Veirana characterized terminal Pleistocene cultures elsewhere36,37. This implies that infant personhood inclusive of females has deeper origins in a common ancestral culture or that it arose in parallel in nearly contemporaneous populations across the planet. Either way, the terminal Pleistocene and earliest Holocene should be considered the minimum antiquity for the recognition of young girls as members of society in cultures around the globe.",
            "As delayed personhood often corresponds with high risk of infant death, the AVH-1 and Upper Sun River burials could suggest relatively low levels of infant mortality even as hunter-gatherers adapted to diverse geography and the shifting environments of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. In some ethnographic examples, when personhood is attributed to infants, abundant grave ornaments served to bolster that status beyond death to compensate for the child\u2019s fragility38. The extension of such treatment to female infants among early Holocene hunter-gatherers suggests a degree of egalitarian treatment of individuals in life and death regardless of age or sex/gender.",

            "Human teeth permanently record growth information during their formation allowing assessment of tooth formation times, stresses experienced during development, and age-at-death (in infants). Dental ontogenetic studies rely on the rhythmical growth of enamel and dentine, producing short and long period incremental markings, visible in longitudinal thin sections of teeth48. The deposition of enamel and dentine matrix is subject to inner biological rhythms: a circadian growth process that produces prismatic cross striations (CS) in enamel and von Ebner\u2019s lines in dentine, and a longer periodicity represented by Retzius lines in enamel and Andresen lines in dentine16,49. Stress events strong enough to disrupt development leave marks in the corresponding position of the enamel or dentine front, visible as Accentuated Lines (ALs)49. Usually, the first accentuated line, characterizing all the deciduous teeth and the first permanent molar of individuals that survive the perinatal stage, is the Neonatal Line (NL), which separates the tissues formed prenatally from that growing after birth50. ALs in the prenatal enamel are relatively rare and indicate physiological stresses affecting the mother or fetus51. The NL is used to calibrate the chronology of stresses and the time of pre- and postnatal crown growth. Histomorphometry of dental enamel allows the collection of parameters such as the Daily Secretion Rate (DSR, i.e. the speed at which the ameloblast\u2014the enamel forming cells\u2014moves towards the outer surface of the tooth) and, for still growing crowns, the age-at-death as the time spent from the NL to the end of enamel formation16,51,52.",

The analytical protocol is described in Lugli et al.23. A small fragment of the tooth (~\u200910\u00a0mg; including both dentine and enamel) was sonicated with MilliQ water and quickly pre-cleaned with 5% HCl. Then, the specimen was digested through 250\u00a0\u03bcl of 5% HCl (suprapur grade). This solution was desalted and purified using a C18silica SpinTip (Thermo Scientific) and dried down overnight under a class 100 laminar-flow hood in the clean room facility of the Department of Chemical and Geological Sciences (University of Modena and Reggio Emilia). Dry peptides were re-suspended using 35\u00a0\u03bcl of a water:acetonitrile:formic acid mixture (95:3:2) and analysed by LC\u2013MS/MS (Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC coupled to a high-resolution Q Exactive mass spectrometer; Thermo Scientific). A run time of 90\u00a0min was employed for the specimen and the blanks; see23for details. The analysis of the AVH-1\u2019s tooth was duplicated. To check the presence of amelogenin proteins we searched the ion chromatograms22,23, focusing on specific peptides as SM(ox)IRPPY (AMELY; [M\u2009+\u20092H]+2440.2233\u00a0m/z) and SIRPPYPSY (AMELX; [M\u2009+\u20092H]+2540.2796\u00a0m/z). Additionally, raw data were converted in Mascot generic format and searched against UniProt (constrained toHomo sapiens) and cRAP (contaminant database, 116 sequences). No proteolytic enzyme was selected in search parameters and one missed cleavage allowed. Deamidated asparagines/glutamine (NQ) and oxidated methionine (M) were set as variable modifications. Error tolerance was set at 10\u00a0ppm for the precursor ions and 0.05\u00a0Da for the product ions. False discovery rate was estimated through an automatic decoy database, with a probability threshold trimmed to a FDR\u2009<\u20091%.

These phenomena generate certain modifications (wrenching and peeling), which were grouped as over-extending damage. Peeling is defined as a roughened surface with parallel grooves and a fibrous texture88.

            "One of the most enduring and widely debated questions in prehistoric archaeology concerns the origins of Europe\u2019s earliest farmers: Were they the descendants of local hunter-gatherers, or did they migrate from southwestern Asia, where farming began? We recover genome-wide DNA sequences from early farmers on both the European and Asian sides of the Aegean to reveal an unbroken chain of ancestry leading from central and southwestern Europe back to Greece and northwestern Anatolia. Our study provides the coup de gr\u00e2ce to the notion that farming spread into and across Europe via the dissemination of ideas but without, or with only a limited, migration of people.",
            "Keywords:paleogenomics, Neolithic, Mesolithic, Greece, Anatolia",
            "Farming and sedentism first appeared in southwestern Asia during the early Holocene and later spread to neighboring regions, including Europe, along multiple dispersal routes. Conspicuous uncertainties remain about the relative roles of migration, cultural diffusion, and admixture with local foragers in the early Neolithization of Europe. Here we present paleogenomic data for five Neolithic individuals from northern Greece and northwestern Turkey spanning the time and region of the earliest spread of farming into Europe. We use a novel approach to recalibrate raw reads and call genotypes from ancient DNA and observe striking genetic similarity both among Aegean early farmers and with those from across Europe. Our study demonstrates a direct genetic link between Mediterranean and Central European early farmers and those of Greece and Anatolia, extending the European Neolithic migratory chain all the way back to southwestern Asia.",
            "It is well established that farming was introduced to Europe from Anatolia, but the extent to which its spread was mediated by demic expansion of Anatolian farmers, or by the transmission of farming technologies and lifeways to indigenous hunter-gatherers without a major concomitant migration of people, has been the subject of considerable debate. Paleogenetic studies (1\u20134) of late hunter-gatherers (HG) and early farmers indicate a dominant role for migration in the transition to farming in central and northern Europe, with evidence of only limited hunter-gatherer admixture into early Neolithic populations, but increasing toward the late Neolithic. However, the exact origin of central and western Europe\u2019s early farmers in the Balkans, Greece, or Anatolia remains an open question.",
            "Recent radiocarbon dating indicates that by 6,600\u20136,500 calibrated (cal) BCE sedentary farming communities were established in northwestern Anatolia at sites such as Barc\u0131n, Mente\u015fe, and Aktoprakl\u0131k C and in coastal western Anatolia at sites such as \u00c7ukuri\u00e7i and Ulucak, but did not expand north or west of the Aegean for another several hundred years (5). All these sites show material culture affinities with the central and southwestern Anatolian Neolithic (6).",
            "Early Greek Neolithic sites, such as the Franchthi Cave in the Peloponnese, Knossos in Crete, and Mauropigi, Paliambela, and Revenia in northern Greece date to a similar period (7\u20139). The distribution of obsidian from the Cycladic islands, as well as similarities in material culture, suggest extensive interactions since the Mesolithic and a coeval Neolithic on both sides of the Aegean (8). Although it has been argued that in situ Aegean Mesolithic hunter-gatherers played a major role in the \u201cNeolithization\u201d of Greece (7), the presence of domesticated forms of plants and animals indicates nonlocal Neolithic dispersals into the area.",
            "We present five ancient genomes from both, the European and Asian sides of the northern Aegean (Fig. 1); despite their origin from nontemperate regions, three of them were sequenced to relatively high coverage (\u223c2\u20137\u00d7), enabling diploid calls using a novel SNP calling method that accurately accounts for postmortem damage (SI Appendix,SI5. Genotype Calling for Ancient DNA). Two of the higher-coverage genomes are from Barc\u0131n, south of the Marmara Sea in Turkey, one of the earliest Neolithic sites in northwestern Anatolia (individuals Bar8 and Bar31). On the European side of the Aegean, one genome is from the early Neolithic site of Revenia (Rev5), and the remaining two are from the late and final Neolithic sites of Paliambela (Pal7) and Kleitos (Klei10), dating to \u223c2,000 y later (Table 1). Estimates of mitochondrial contamination were low (0.006\u20131.772% for shotgun data) (Table 1;SI Appendix,SI4. Analysis of Uniparental Markers and X Chromosome Contamination Estimates.). We found unprecedented deamination rates of up to 56% in petrous bone samples, indicating a prehistoric origin for our sequence data from nontemperate environments (SI Appendix, Table S5).",

Contamination was estimated on mitochondrial (mt) DNA. \u2014, indicates no genomic data available; *, indicates not applicable.",
            "The mtDNA haplogroups of all five Neolithic individuals are typical of those found in central European Neolithic farmers and modern Europeans, but not in European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (1). Likewise, the Y-chromosomes of the two male individuals belong to haplogroup G2a2, which has been observed in European Neolithic farmers (3,10); in \u00d6tzi, the Tyrolean Iceman (11); and in modern western and southwestern Eurasian populations, but not in any pre-Neolithic European hunter-gatherers (12). The mitochondrial haplogroups of two additional less well-preserved Greek Mesolithic individuals (Theo1, Theo5;SI Appendix, Table S6) belong to lineages observed in Neolithic farmers from across Europe; consistent with Aegean Neolithic populations, unlike central European Neolithic populations, being the direct descendants of the preceding Mesolithic peoples who inhabited broadly the same region. However, we caution against over-interpretation of the Aegean Mesolithic mtDNA data; additional genome-level data will be required to identify the Mesolithic source population(s) of the early Aegean farmers.",
            "Sequences in and around genes underlying the phenotypes hypothesized to have undergone positive selection in Europeans indicate that the Neolithic Aegeans were unlikely to have been lactase persistent but carried derivedSLC24A5rs1426654 andSLC45A2rs16891982 alleles associated with reduced skin pigmentation. Because our Aegean samples predate the period when the rs4988235 T-allele associated with lactase persistence in Eurasia reached an appreciable frequency in Europe, around 4 kya (12\u201314), and because this allele remains at relatively low frequencies (<0.15) in modern Greek, Turkish, and Sardinian populations (15), this observation is unsurprising. However, despite their relatively low latitude, four of the Aegean individuals are homozygous for the derived rs1426654 T-allele in theSLC24A5gene, and four carry at least one copy of the derived rs16891982 G-allele in theSLC45A2gene. This suggests that these reduced-pigmentation\u2013associated alleles were at appreciable frequency in Neolithic Aegeans and that skin depigmentation was not solely a high-latitude phenomenon (SI Appendix,SI12. Functional Markers). The derived rs12913832 G-allele in theHERC2domain of theOCA2gene was heterozygous in one individual (Klei10), but all other Aegeans for whom the allelic state at this locus could be determined were homozygous for the ancestral allele, indicating a lack of iris depigmentation in these individuals.",
            "Examination of several SNPs in theTCF7L2gene region indicates that the two Neolithic Anatolian individuals, Bar8 and Bar31, are likely to have carried at least one copy of a haplotype conferring reduced susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D); the Klei10 and Rev5 individuals also carry a tag allele associated with this haplotype. Consistent with these observations, it has been previously estimated that this T2D-protective haplotype, which shows evidence for selection in Europeans, East Asians, and West Africans, originated \u223c11,900 y ago in Europe (16).",
            "A number of loci associated with inflammatory disease displayed the derived alleles, including rs2188962 C > T in theSLC22A5/IRF1region, associated with Crohn\u2019s disease; rs3184504 C > T in theSH2B3/ATXN2region, associated with rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes; and rs6822844 G > T in theIL2/IL21region, associated with rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, and ulcerative colitis. Interestingly, we observe derived states for six of eight loci in a protein\u2013protein interaction network inferred to have undergone concerted positive selection 2.6\u20131.2 kya in Europeans (17), suggesting that any recent selection on these loci acted on standing variation present at already appreciable frequency (SI Appendix,SI12.

This cluster remains well-defined when the third dimension of variation is also considered (https://figshare.com/articles/Hofmanova_et_al_3D_figure_S4/3188767). Two recently published pre-Neolithic genomes from the Caucasus (20) appear to be highly differentiated from the genomes presented here and most likely represent a forager population distinct from the Epipaleolithic/Mesolithic precursors of the early Aegean farmers.",

            "PCA of modern reference populations (18,19) and projected ancient individuals. The Greek and Anatolian samples reported here cluster tightly with other European farmers close to modern-day Sardinians; however, they are clearly distinct from previously published Caucasian hunter-gatherers (20). This excludes the latter as a potential ancestral source population for early European farmers and suggests a strong genetic structure in hunter-gatherers of Southwest Asia. Central and East European (C./E. European), South European (South Eur.). Ancient DNA data: Pleistocene hunter-gatherer (Plei. HG) (20,21,22), Holocene hunter-gatherer (Holocene HG) (2,4,13,20,23), Neolithic (2,4,12,13,24), Late Neolithic/Chalcolithic/Copper Age (LN/Chalc./CA) (13,25), and Bronze Age (13). Ancient samples are abbreviated consistently using the nomenclature \u201csite-country code-culture\u201d; seeSI Appendix, Table S14andDataset S1for more information. A 3D PCA plot can be viewed as a 3D figure (https://figshare.com/articles/Hofmanova_et_al_3D_figure_S4/3188767).",
            "To examine this clustering of Early Neolithic farmers in more detail, we calculated outgroupf3 statistics (26) of the formf3 (\u2021Khomani; TEST, Greek/Anatolian), where TEST is one of the available ancient European genomes (SI Appendix,SI7. Using f-statistics to Infer Genetic Relatedness and Admixture Amongst Ancient andContemporary Populationsand Figs. S8\u2013S10;Dataset S2); \u2021Khomani San were selected as an outgroup as they are considered to be the most genetically diverged extant human population. Consistent with their PCA clustering, the northern Aegean genomes share high levels of genetic drift with each other and with all other previously characterized European Neolithic genomes, including early Neolithic from northern Spain, Hungary, and central Europe. Given the archaeological context of the different samples, the most parsimonious explanation for this shared drift is migration of early European farmers from the northern Aegean into and across Europe (12).",
            "To better characterize this inferred migration, we modeled ancient and modern genomes as mixtures of DNA from other ancient and/or modern genomes, a flexible approach that characterizes the amount of ancestry sharing among multiple groups simultaneously (18,27) (Fig. 3;SI Appendix,SI10. Comparing Allele Frequency Patterns Among Samples Using a Mixture Model). Briefly, we first represented each ancient or modern \u201ctarget\u201d group by the (weighted) number of alleles that they share in common with individuals from a fixed set of sampled populations (i.e., the \u201cunlinked\u201d approach described in ref.27), which we refer to as the \u201callele-matching profile\u201d for that target group. To cope with issues such as unequal sample sizes, we then used a linear model (28) to fit the allele-matching profile of the target group as a mixture of that of other sampled groups. Sampled groups that contribute most to this mixture indicate a high degree of shared ancestry with the target group relative to other groups. Under this framework the oldest Anatolian genome (Bar31) was inferred to contribute the highest amount of genetic ancestry (39\u201353%) to the Early Neolithic genomes from Hungary (13) and Germany (2) compared with any other ancient or modern samples, with the next highest contributors being other ancient Aegean genomes (Klei10, Pal7, Bar8) (SI Appendix, Figs. S23, S24, and S29). This pattern is not symmetric in that we infer smaller contributions from the German (<26%) and Hungarian (<43%) Neolithic genomes to any of the Anatolian or Greek ancient genomes. Furthermore, in this analysis modern samples from Europe and surrounding regions are inferred to be relatively more genetically related to the Aegean Neolithic genomes than to the Neolithic genomes from Germany and Hungary (Fig. 3;SI Appendix,SI10. Comparing Allele Frequency Patterns Among Samples Using a Mixture Model). These patterns are indicative of founder effects (29) in the German and possibly Hungarian Neolithic samples from a source that appears to be most genetically similar to the Aegean Neolithic samples (specifically, Bar31) and that distinguishes them from the ancestors of modern groups. Consistent with this, we found fewer short runs of homozygosity (ROH) (between 1 and 2 Mb) in our high-coverage Anatolian sample (Bar8) than in Early Neolithic genomes from Germany and Hungary (SI Appendix,SI11. Runs of Homozygosityand Fig. S31). However, it is not possible to infer a direction for dispersal within the Aegean with statistical confidence because both the Greek and Anatolian genomes copy from each other to a similar extent. We therefore see the origins of European farmers equally well represented by Early Neolithic Greek and northwestern Anatolian genomes.",

            "Ongoing gene flow into and across the Aegean is also indicated in the genome of a Chalcolithic individual from Kumtepe [Kum6 (25)], a site geographically close to Barc\u0131n but dating to \u223c1,600 y later. Although archaeological evidence indicates a cultural break in many Aegean and West Anatolian settlements around 5,700/5,600 cal BCE [i.e., spanning this 1,600-y period (30)], Kum6 shows affinities to the Barc\u0131n genomes in \u201coutgroup\u201df3-statistics in the formf3(\u2021Khomani; TEST, Greek/Anatolian). The shared drift between Kum6 and both the early and late Neolithic Aegeans is similar in extent to the drift that Aegeans share with one another. However,f4statistics of the formf4(Aegean, Kum6, Early farmer, \u2021Khomani) were often significantly positive (SI Appendix, Table S22;Dataset S2), suggesting that European Neolithic farmers [namely, Linearbandkeramik (LBK), Starcevo, and Early Hungarian Neolithic farmers] share some ancestry with early Neolithic Aegeans that is absent in Kum6. This is consistent with population structure in the Early Neolithic Aegean or with Kum6 being sampled from a population that differentiated from early Neolithic Aegeans after they expanded into the rest of Europe. Accordingly, compared with Barc\u0131n, Kum6 shares unique drift with the Late Neolithic genomes from Greece (Klei10 and Pal7), consistent with ongoing gene flow across the Aegean during the fifth millennium and with archaeological evidence demonstrating similarities in Kumtepe ceramic types with the Greek Late Neolithic (31). Finally, the Kum6, Klei10, and Pal7 genomes show signals of Caucasus hunter-gatherer (20) admixture that is absent in the Barc\u0131n genomes, suggesting post early Neolithic gene flow into the Aegean from the east.",
            "It is widely believed that farming spread into Europe along both Mediterranean and central European routes, but the extent to which this process involved multiple dispersals from the Aegean has long been a matter of debate (32). We calculatedf4statistics to examine whether the Aegean Neolithic farmers shared drift with genomes from the Spanish Epicardial site Els Trocs in the Pyrenees (3,12) that is distinct from that shared with Early Neolithic genomes from Germany and Hungary. In a test of the formf4(Germany/Hungary EN, Spain EN, Aegean, \u2021Khomani), we infer significant unique drift among Neolithic Aegeans (not significantly in Bar8) and Early Neolithic Spain to the exclusion of Hungarian and German Neolithic genomes (SI Appendix, Table S21). The best explanation for this observation is that migration to southwestern Europe started in the Aegean but was independent from the movement to Germany via Hungary. This is also supported by other genetic inferences (24) and archaeological evidence (33). An alternative scenario is a very rapid colonization along a single route with subsequent gene flow back to Greece from Spain. Potentially, preexisting hunter-gatherer networks along the western Mediterranean could have produced a similar pattern, but this is not supported by archaeological data. Interestingly, \u00d6tzi the Tyrolean Iceman (11) shows unique shared drift with Aegeans to the exclusion of Hungarian Early Neolithic farmers and Late and Post Neolithic European genomes and feasibly represents a relict of Early Neolithic Aegeans (SI Appendix,SI7. Using f-statistics to Infer Genetic Relatedness and Admixture Amongst Ancient and Contemporary Populationsand Table S18).",
            "Given that the Aegean is the likely origin of European Neolithic farmers, we used Bar8 and Bar31 as putative sources to assess the extent of hunter-gatherer admixture in European farmers through the Neolithic.f4statistics of the formf4(Neolithic farmer, Anatolian, HG, \u2021Khomani) indicated small but significant amounts of hunter-gatherer admixture into both Spanish and Hungarian early farmer genomes, and interestingly, the Early Neolithic Greek genome. Our mixture modeling analysis also inferred a small genetic contribution from the Loschbour hunter-gatherer genome (3\u20139%) to each of the Early Neolithic Hungarian and German genomes, but evidence of a smaller contribution to any Aegean genomes (0\u20136%). These results suggest that mixing between migrating farmers and local hunter-gatherers occurred sporadically at low levels throughout the continent even in the earliest stages of the Neolithic. However, consistent with previous findings (3), bothf4statistics and ADMIXTURE analysis indicate a substantial increase in hunter-gatherer ancestry transitioning into the Middle Neolithic across Europe, whereas Late Neolithic farmers also demonstrate a considerable input of ancestry from steppe populations (SI Appendix,SI8. Proportions of Ancestral Clusters in Neolithic Populations of Europeand Fig. S32).",
            "Most of the modern Anatolian and Aegean populations do not appear to be the direct descendants of Neolithic peoples from the same region. Indeed, our mixture model comparison of the Aegean genomes to >200 modern groups (2) indicates low affinity between the two Anatolian Neolithic genomes and six of eight modern Turkish samples; the other two were sampled near the Aegean Sea at a location close to the site of the Neolithic genomes. Furthermore, when we form each Anatolian Neolithic genome as a mixture of all modern groups, we infer no contributions from groups in southeastern Anatolia and the Levant, where the earliest Neolithic sites are found (SI Appendix, Figs. S22 and S30 and Table S30;Dataset S3). Similarly, comparison of allele sharing between ancient and modern genomes to those expected under population continuity indicates Neolithic-to-modern discontinuity in Greece and western Anatolia, unless ancestral populations were unrealistically small (SI Appendix,SI9. Population Continuity). Instead, our mixing analysis shows that each Aegean Neolithic genome closely corresponds to modern Mediterraneans (>68% contributions from southern Europe) and in particular to Sardinians (>25%), as also seen in the PCA and outgroupf3statistics with few substantial contributions from elsewhere. Modern groups matching the Neolithics\u2014mostly from the Mediterranean and North Africa\u2014strikingly match more to Bar8 from northwestern Anatolia than to the LBK genome from Stuttgart in Germany, indicating that the LBK genome experienced processes such as drift and admixture that were independent from the Mediterranean expansion route, consistent with the dual expansion model.",
            "Over the past 7 years, ancient DNA studies have transformed our understanding of the European Neolithic transition (1\u20134,12,13), demonstrating a crucial role for migration in central and southwestern Europe. Our results further advance this transformative understanding by extending the unbroken trail of ancestry and migration all of the way back to southwestern Asia.",
            "The high levels of shared drift between Aegean and all available Early Neolithic genomes in Europe, together with the inferred unique drift between Neolithic Aegeans and Early Neolithic genomes from Northern Spain to the exclusion of Early Neolithic genomes from central Europe, indicate that Aegean Neolithic populations can be considered the root for all early European farmers and that at least two independent colonization routes were followed.",
            "A key remaining question is whether this unbroken trail of ancestry and migration extends all the way back to southeastern Anatolia and the Fertile Crescent, where the earliest Neolithic sites in the world are found. Regardless of whether the Aegean early farmers ultimately descended from western or central Anatolian, or even Levantine hunter-gatherers, the differences between the ancient genomes presented here and those from the Caucasus (20) indicate that there was considerable structuring of forager populations in southwestern Asia before the transition to farming. The dissimilarity and lack of continuity of the Early Neolithic Aegean genomes to most modern Turkish and Levantine populations, in contrast to those of early central and southwestern European farmers and modern Mediterraneans, is best explained by subsequent gene flow into Anatolia from still unknown sources.",
            "Five Neolithic and two Mesolithic samples from both sides of the Aegean were selected for ancient DNA extraction and sequencing (Table 1). DNA was extracted, and Next Generation Sequencing libraries were constructed in dedicated ancient DNA facilities as previously described (1,34) with slight modifications. DNA quality and quantity of all samples were derived from the combination of estimates of endogenous DNA content based on the percentage of reads mapping to the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) after shallow Illumina Miseq sequencing and estimating the DNA copy number of extracts by quantitative PCR. The five Neolithic samples (Bar8, Bar31, Rev5, Klei10, and Pal7) showed endogenous DNA contents between 8.80 and 60.83% and underwent deep Illumina whole-genome resequencing. The two Mesolithic samples (Theo 1 and Theo 5) showed endogenous DNA content of only 0.05% and 0.62%, respectively, and were used to capture the full mitochondrial genome.SI Appendix, Fig. S1, displays the relationship between endogenous DNA content and copy number for each sample and DNA extraction. The enrichment of the mitochondrial genome was carried out with Agilent\u2019s SureSelectXTin-solution target enrichment kit. The protocol for the preparation of further libraries for shotgun sequencing and capture was modified according to previously estimated sample quality, whereby some libraries from samples Bar8, Bar31, and Rev5 were prepared with USER treated DNA extract.

            "To compose a target group as mixtures of other sampled groups, we used the following two-step procedure. First, we used a previously described technique (27) to infer an allele-matching profile for each target group by comparing its allele frequencies independently at each SNP to that of a set of \u201cdonor\u201d groups. In particular, at a given SNP for each chromosome in our target group, we identified all X nonmissing donor chromosomes that shared the same allele type as the target and assigned each of these donors a score of 1/X and all other donors a score of 0. We did this for each SNP and each target individual and then summed up these scores across SNPs and target individuals to give an allele-matching profile for the target group conditional on that set of donors. For each target group, the contributions from each donor group were rescaled to sum to 1. For analyses presented here, our donor groups consisted of modern individuals (2) (plus Neanderthal and Denisova). Our target groups included all modern and ancient groups. Next, analogous to ref.18, we performed a multiple linear regression using the target group\u2019s allele-matching profile as a response and a set of allele-matching profiles of different \u201csurrogate\u201d groups as predictors. In all analyses, we used three different sets of surrogate groups: (i) all (or a subset of) modern groups, (ii) all ancient groups and all (or a subset of) modern groups, and (iii) the modern Yoruba plus all (or a subset of) ancient groups. Mixture coefficients were inferred using nonnegative least squares in R with a slight modification to ensure that the coefficients sum to 1 (SI Appendix,SI10. Comparing Allele Frequency Patterns Among Samples Using a Mixture Model).",

For our purposes a continuous population is defined as \u201ca single panmictic population without admixture from other populations.\u201d Our approach is designed to test continuity using a single ancient genome and a set of modern genomes. We designate alleles as ancestral or derived by comparing them to the chimpanzee genome (panTro2) and consider only haploid calls for the ancient genome to avoid genotype calling biases. We examine the proportion of allele sharing between the ancient haploid and modern diploid genome calls that fall into each of the following six classes: A/AA; D/DD; A/DD; D/AA; A/AD; D/AD (where A = ancestral and D = derived alleles in the ancient haploid/modern diploid genomes, respectively). To generate expected proportions of these allele-sharing classes, we forward-simulate genetic drift by binomial sampling from a set of allele frequency vectors based on the modern site frequency spectrum. Finally, we use Fisher\u2019s method to combine two-tailedPvalues for the observed sharing class fractions falling into the simulated ranges and compare the resultant \u03c72values to those obtained by comparing each simulation against the set of all other simulations (46) to obtain aPvalue.

            "The debate concerning the origin of the Polynesian speaking peoples has been recently reinvigorated by genetic evidence for secondary migrations to western Polynesia from the New Guinea region during the 2nd millennium BP. Using genome-wide autosomal data from the Leeward Society Islands, the ancient cultural hub of eastern Polynesia, we find that the inhabitants\u2019 genomes also demonstrate evidence of this episode of admixture, dating to 1,700\u20131,200\u2009BP. This supports a late settlement chronology for eastern Polynesia, commencing ~1,000\u2009BP, after the internal differentiation of Polynesian society. More than 70% of the autosomal ancestry of Leeward Society Islanders derives from Island Southeast Asia with the lowland populations of the Philippines as the single largest potential source. These long-distance migrants into Polynesia experienced additional admixture with northern Melanesians prior to the secondary migrations of the 2nd millennium BP. Moreover, the genetic diversity of mtDNA and Y chromosome lineages in the Leeward Society Islands is consistent with linguistic evidence for settlement of eastern Polynesia proceeding from the central northern Polynesian outliers in the Solomon Islands. These results stress the complex demographic history of the Leeward Society Islands and challenge phylogenetic models of cultural evolution predicated on eastern Polynesia being settled from Samoa.",
            "The cultural and linguistic unity of the islands and atolls of the central Pacific was first documented in detail by Johann Reinhold Forster, a naturalist on James Cook\u2019s second voyage of discovery to the Pacific (1772\u20131775). He suggested that the similarity of the languages spoken there, now known as Polynesian, reflected a comparatively shallow time-depth since their dispersal1. Forster\u2019s seminal comparative study of Austronesian languages identified the lowland region of the Philippines in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) as the ultimate source for the Polynesian languages and proposed a long-distance migration from there by the ancestors of today\u2019s Polynesian speakers. This appeared to be the only explanation for the striking difference in phenotype that he observed between the peoples of the central Pacific and those of the intervening region, which is now known as Melanesia. Herein, the terms Melanesia and Micronesia are used in their geographical sense. We use the term Polynesia to include all islands and atolls whose inhabitants speak Polynesian languages, including 23 found throughout Melanesia and Micronesia, referred to as outlier Polynesia (Fig.1a).",

            "Separating the demographic histories of Polynesia and Melanesia became difficult to sustain with developments in archaeology during the second half of the 20th century. These established that the settlement of southern Melanesia (Santa Cruz, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji) and western Polynesia (Tonga, Samoa, Niue and Futuna) is marked by the same archaeological horizon, known as the Lapita Cultural Complex (LCC). The LCC first appears in northern Melanesia (the Bismarck Archipelago, Bougainville, and the Solomon Islands main chain) ~3,450\u20133,250\u2009BP, and quickly spread into southern Melanesia ~3,200\u20133,000\u2009BP, reaching Tonga and Samoa ~2,900\u2009BP2\u20134. At the same time, the study of comparative linguistics has shown that the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian phylum of languages, of which Polynesian is a member, is spoken throughout most of Melanesia and parts of coastal New Guinea, and appears to be a recent intrusion from ISEA5. So while there is considerable overlap between the distributions of the LCC and the Oceanic languages, there remains a phenotypic divide between southern Melanesia and western Polynesia, which is observed between Fiji and Tonga6,7.",
            "A central theme in this debate is the extent to which the development of the LCC involved local people in the Bismarck Archipelago of northern Melanesia8\u201310. An alternative is that the LCC represents the arrival of a largely pre-formed cultural package carried by speakers of proto-Oceanic languages from Taiwan, via the Philippines, in ISEA11. Hypotheses are placed on a continuum from a dendritic, radiating, phylogenetic model of cultural evolution that relies on the relative isolation of populations12, to one based on complex ongoing biological and cultural interaction between groups, leading to reticulated networks of genes and culture9. A compromise position has been promoted by the recognition of a Lapita homeland in the Bismarck Archipelago10, together with evidence that the genomes of contemporary Polynesians contain 20\u201330% ancestry typical of northern Melanesia and New Guinea13,14. This posits a period of limited cultural and genetic admixture involving migrants from ISEA during the early LCC phase in northern Melanesia ~3,450\u20133,250\u2009BP15. Polynesian society then developed in relative isolation following the pioneering settlement of Tonga and Samoa ~2,900\u2009BP12.",
            "Genetic evidence for this intermediate model is provided by the presence of members of Y chromosome haplogroup (hg) C2a-M208, together with its daughter lineage C2a1-P33, among Polynesian speakers16,17. This is seen as a proxy for male-mediated admixture from northern Melanesian and New Guinean sources into the gene pool of migrants from ISEA during the formative period of the LCC in the Bismarck Archipelago, prior to the settlement of southern Melanesia and western Polynesia13,18. In contrast, the near fixation in Polynesian speaking groups of the mitochondrial lineage B4a1a1 is seen as evidence of a predominantly ISEA maternal heritage13,19. Subsequent research, however, has shown that B4a1a1 is widespread throughout northern Melanesia20, including regions that show no evidence of autosomal admixture with people from ISEA21. Alternatively, therefore, hg B4a1a1 might also have been present in northern Melanesia before the emergence of the LCC22,23. Similar ambiguity now exists over the origins of paternal lineage C2a-M208, due to its presence in ISEA24and rather low overall frequencies in the Bismarck Archipelago and coastal New Guinea17.",
            "An important advance in this debate is the recovery of ancient genomic DNA from LCC contexts on Vanuatu (~2,900\u2009BP) (n=\u20093) and post-Lapita Tonga (~2,500\u2009BP) (n=\u20091), since the results indicate people with close to 100% ancestry related to an ISEA heritage25. These data show that some settlers of the LCC period appear to have transited northern Melanesia and New Guinea from ISEA without receiving any significant amounts of genetic admixture. A second major finding is that the 20\u201330% ancestry originating from northern Melanesia and New Guinea, detected in contemporary genomes from the eastern fringe of southern Melanesia and western Polynesia, appears to have arrived during the 2ndmillennium BP (1,900\u20131,200\u2009BP). This result is consistent with post-LCC movements of people into southern Melanesia and western Polynesia, in a process of polygenesis, being responsible for the differences in phenotype observed between the two regions6.",
            "The potential significance of this proposed post-LCC migration for the phylogenetic approach to cultural evolution cannot be overstated. This is because the model is based on an Ancestral Polynesian Society (APS) developing in a western Polynesian homeland during the mid 3rdmillennium BP, followed by a rapid settlement of eastern Polynesia ~2,200\u2009BP12. The settlement of eastern Polynesia, however, has witnessed significant reductions in the earliest secure radiometric dates in recent years. These currently stand at ~950\u2009BP and come from Rai\u2019atea in the Leeward Society Isles26,27, thereby excluding the original calibration for the model and subsequent revisions to it28. The archaeology for the phylogenetic model can also be challenged because the evidence post 2,500\u2009BP suggests isolation of Tonga and Samoa, rather than the interaction invoked for the development of Proto-Polynesian language29. By ~950\u2009BP, society in western Polynesia was differentiated, both culturally and linguistically, indicating that, if this late chronology is accurate, the source population for eastern Polynesia was likely a regional group rather than the\u00a0hypothetical APS29,30.",
            "A central component of the original phylogenetic model is the long-standing sub-grouping of the Polynesian languages. The initial divergence of Nuclear Polynesian from the Tongic languages is followed by a second-order split, between Proto-East Polynesian (Rapa Nui, Marquesan and Tahitic) and the rest of the Nuclear Polynesian languages (Samoic and all the Polynesian outlier languages)31(Fig.1b, left-hand tree). This sub-grouping recognizes the separation of Tongic and Samoic but is difficult to reconcile with a settlement of eastern Polynesia commencing ~950\u2009BP, since it necessitates the second-order split, involving Proto-East Polynesian, to occur up to ~1,200 years earlier. An alternative linguistic sub-grouping that places the East Polynesian languages together with those of the central northern outliers (east coast of the northern Solomon Islands) provides a potential solution for the apparent discordance between archaeology and language32,33(Fig.1b, right-hand tree). This also challenges the orthodoxy within Polynesian studies that eastern Polynesia was settled directly from Samoa11,12,28. For Kirch and Green28, Samoa is ancient Hawa\u2019iki, the cradle of Polynesian culture. In contrast, for Wilson32Hawa\u2019iki represents the ancient name for the Leeward Society Isles, which are referred to as the cultural and spiritual hub of eastern Polynesia in oral histories of the region, from where other islands and atolls were settled34.",
            "The Leeward Society Isles, therefore, are of central importance to understanding the reasons for these conflicting signals from archaeology and language. If the ancestors of the Leeward Society Islanders experienced the same episode of ancient admixture as people in western Polynesia and outlier Polynesia during the mid 2ndmillennium BP25, this would support the late settlement chronology. In this study, we report the first genomic data from Bora Bora, Rai\u2019atea and Taha\u2019a, three of the Leeward Society Isles. We use the analysis of genotype and haplotype data to ascertain whether the signals of admixture present in these eastern Polynesian populations are similar to those from western and outlier Polynesia and identify potential donors to the ancestors of the Leeward Society Islanders. Further insights into the demographic history of eastern Polynesia is provided by the first deep re-sequencing of Polynesian Y chromosomes, complemented by high-resolution genotyping of key paternal and maternal lineages from the Leeward Society Isles and New Zealand.",
            "Here we present a new genomic dataset sampled from the Leeward Society Islands, eastern Polynesia. We report high-resolution autosomal genotyping data from 30 individuals, complemented by genotyping and/or re-sequencing of uniparental loci (mtDNA and Y) from 81 individuals, including seven Y chromosomes re-sequenced by a target-capture method. In addition, we present new uniparental data from 49 Maori individuals sampled in New Zealand (Supplementary TablesS1\u2013S3). The dataset is analyzed together with publicly available data from Island Southeast Asia, Melanesia and Polynesia (Supplementary TablesS1,S4andS5). For detailed information about samples used in the present study, please refer to the Materials and Methods section.",
            "The first two PCs of the principal components analysis (PCA, Fig.1c) account for 38% of the variation in the studied dataset. The close overlap between eastern Polynesians and Samoans on the PC1 axis suggests similar amounts of genetic ancestry shared with New Guinea and northern Melanesia. The model-based analysis of autosomal SNPs using ADMIXTURE35shows that, atK=\u20094, 70\u201380% of the Leeward Society Islander genomes can be characterized by the component typical of ISEA/East Asia (Fig.2a); the remaining 20\u201330% of their genetic ancestry is best represented by Papuan speakers from New Guinea (light purple). FromK=\u20095, Polynesians take their own ancestry (green), which, like their deflection on the PCA plot, is most likely due to genetic drift or, alternatively, cryptic relatedness or extreme inbreeding in studied populations. However, the latter is unlikely due to the lack of close relatives (up to third-degree, inclusive) in four Polynesian groups, and normal range of inbreeding coefficients when comparing to other human populations (FIS, Supplementary TableS6).",
            "",
            "Ancestral genomic components in study populations estimated using ADMIXTURE. Details of the populations are provided in Supplementary TableS1B. The colors used have been selected to be equivalent to those used in Fig.1. Only runs fromK=\u20094 to 10 are shown, complete results (K=\u20092 to 15) are given in Supplementary Fig.S1. (a) For every value of K, the modal solution with the highest number (superscript) of ADMIXTURE35runs is shown; individual ancestry proportions were averaged across all runs and the average cross-validation statistics were calculated across all runs from the same mode (Supplementary Fig.S2). The minimum cross-validation score is observed at K\u2009=\u200911 but no further components appear in the profiles of Polynesians after K\u2009=\u200910. Populations from the Philippines can be generally divided into Negritos (Aeta, Agta and Batak), Kankanaey of northwestern Luzon, and all others representing an amalgamation of groups from Luzon, Palawan and Visayas (see Fig.1and Supplementary TableS1B). (b) The average of K\u2009=\u200910 ADMIXTURE profiles for groups of Leeward Society individuals clustered by fineSTRUCTURE37(Supplementary Fig.S6), indicating the heterogeneous distribution of East Asian and European ancestry among the Leeward Society Islanders.",
            "The lowest cross-validation (CV) score of ADMIXTURE is observed atK=\u200911, but no additional ancestries appear in Polynesians afterK=\u200910, which has the second lowest CV score (Fig.2a, Supplementary FigsS1andS2). AtK=\u200910, a dark blue component appears that is almost fixed in the Kankanaey of northwestern Luzon. The distinctive and uniform profiles of additional ISEA, Melanesian, and East Asian ancestries in two (Tonga and Samoa) out of four, otherwise very closely related, Polynesian groups hint that these may be the result of an old admixture process, rather than genetic drift, extreme bottlenecks or algorithmic artifacts. In contrast, the noticeably uneven distribution of the East Asian (yellow) and western European (grey) ancestry components within the profiles of the Leeward Society individuals (Fig.2b) is consistent with recent historical admixture events (see haplotype-based admixture analysis below).",
            "The outgroupf336allele-sharing plot shows the length of a phylogenetic branch shared between two study populations and African Yoruba. For the Leeward Society Isles (Supplementary Fig.S3, Supplementary TableS7), thef3allele-sharing results are consistent with a most recent evolutionary history shared with Samoa, Tahiti, and Tonga. It also suggests that the Kankanaey of the Philippines and Taiwanese aborigines are the next closest populations to all four Polynesian groups. These results remain robust to the different SNP subsets or population clustering schemes used in the present study (Supplementary FigsS3,S4, Supplementary TableS7). In contrast, thef3 admixture plots (Supplementary Fig.S5, Supplementary TableS7), which detect the presence of admixture in a study population from two reference groups, display different results for western and eastern Polynesia. These differences could be explained by a reduced effective population size for eastern Polynesians, caused by bottlenecks during the initial settlement process, or because Tonga and Samoa have experienced additional admixture since they last shared a common ancestral gene pool with Tahiti and the Leeward Society Isles.",
            "The unsupervised fineSTRUCTURE (FS) analysis of haplotypes37placed individuals into genetic clusters that include: Philippine groups from lowland Luzon, Palawan, and Visayas (\u2018Philippines 1\u2019), Malaysia, Sulawesi, East Asia, northern Melanesia (Bougainville), New Guinea, and western Europe (Supplementary Fig.S6). The GLOBETROTTER (GT) analysis38produced strong statistical support for two separate episodes of admixture involving the ancestors of the Leeward Society Islanders (Fig.3, Supplementary TableS8). The first represents an average contribution of ~6% western European ancestry, which is dated to 1749\u20131803 CE. This is consistent with documented contact during Cook\u2019s three voyages of exploration1, which took place 1768-71, 1772-75 and 1776-80. The second episode is estimated to have occurred in an interval from ~1,200 to 1,700\u2009BP (229\u2013725 CE), and is composed of a minor component (~17%), comprising mainly northern Melanesian and New Guinea sources, and a major one (~83%), in which the largest contributions are attributable to the \u2018Philippines 1\u2019, Sulawesi, and Malaysian clusters. The chronology indicates that this episode occurred prior to the earliest widely accepted radiometric dates for the permanent settlement of eastern Polynesia, which centre on ~950\u2009BP and come from archaeological sites on Rai\u2019atea in the Leeward Society Isles26,27. In addition, the presence of northern Melanesian ancestry in the minor component of the second (older) episode of admixture (~8% of the genome) reflects some genetic contact with this region for the ancestors of the Leeward Society Islanders prior to 1,200\u20131,700\u2009BP.",
            "",
            "Population admixture events and inferred contact dates. Admixture events between genetic clusters obtained using fineSTRUCTURE37(FS, Supplementary Fig.S6) and estimated with GLOBETROTTER38(GT, Supplementary TableS8) for the Leeward Society Isles group. Each color represents a separate genetic cluster estimated with FS that acts as a donor to the recipient cluster (Leeward Society Isles) in the GT analysis. These donor groups are: Europe, East Asia, Malaysia, northern Melanesia (Bougainville), Philippines (\u2018Philippine 1\u2019 cluster in FS), New Guinea and Sulawesi. \u2018Other\u2019 represents an amalgamation of groups contributing less than 3% ancestry to the admixture episodes in the genomes of Leeward Society Islanders. There is strong statistical support for two episodes of admixture; the ancient and recent events are represented by the left- and right-hand bar plots, respectively. Each episode involves two pairs of sources (minor and major); bar plots depict the inferred composition of the mixing sources for each, with admixture dates calculated using a generation time of 28 years. The dates for the older episode are given in the format of Common Era (CE) and Before Present (BP) for convenience. Detailed information about the inferred admixture episodes and composition of mixing sources is given in Supplementary TableS8.",
            "In order to investigate the presence of the northern Melanesian contributions further, we performed a GT analysis on different subsets of Leeward Society Islanders as recipient groups (Supplementary Fig.S7, Supplementary TableS8). The results produced a spread of dates for the older episode of admixture, but always partitioned the northern Melanesian contribution into both sides of the admixture episode with point estimates ranging betweenca1,200 and 1,850\u2009BP. Some of the variability in the dating may be due to the heterogeneous distribution of what appears to be recent admixture with people of East Asian ancestry (Figs2B,S7, Supplementary TableS8), but the result is robust to variations in the makeup of the recipient group. This result, therefore, provides important evidence for either a period of migration from northern Melanesia into the ancestors of eastern Polynesians during the 3rdmillennium BP, or a process of biological admixture taking place during the LCC period in northern Melanesia prior to the pioneering settlement of Polynesia ~3,000\u2009BP.",
            "A further insight from the FS and GT analyses of haplotypes is the clear delineation between possible donor groups within the Philippine palette of populations. This excludes the Aeta, Batak, and Kankanaey clusters from any significant contribution to the population ancestral to the Leeward Society Isles (Figs3,S7, Supplementary TableS8). The Philippine populations from the regions of Luzon, Palawan, and Visayas form a \u2018Philippines 1\u2019 cluster, which contributes nearly 40% of the genome of the Leeward Society Islanders. The apparent discrepancy with the analysis of unlinked SNPs (Supplementary FigsS3andS4), which indicates the Kankanaey as being closest to the Leeward Society Isles, may be caused by the two methods measuring different aspects of the underlying genetic structure. In addition, ascertainment bias inherent to genotyping arrays data can affect the allele-sharing statistics. The GT analysis, in contrast, is based on combinations of linked markers, and is consequently more powerful and robust for identification of complex admixture events38.",
            "Ninety-six percent of Leeward Society Isles mitochondrial lineages belong to the haplogroup (hg) B4a1a1 typical of Polynesian speaking populations. A PCA plot based on frequencies of mtDNA B4a1a lineages (Supplementary Fig.S8) places the Leeward Society Islands closest to Ontong Java (central northern Polynesian outlier, Fig.1a) with the major western Polynesian populations of Tonga and Samoa among the most distant from eastern Polynesians. The Bayesian estimate of the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for well-supported clades of mitochondrial hg B4a1a1 (Supplementary TableS10A) is consistent with more than a third being significantly older than the first settlement of southern Melanesia and western Polynesia. The diversity-based age for B4a1a1 among Polynesian-speaking groups at ~5,700\u2009BP (4,100\u20137,700\u2009BP) is substantially older than the age of the LCC in northern Melanesia.",
            "The major Y chromosome haplogroup in the Leeward Society Isles is C2a1-P33 (67%), a sub-clade of C2a-M208, as it is throughout eastern Polynesia16, including the New Zealand Maori (52%), and the central northern outlier of Ontong Java (Supplementary TableS9B). Many of the haplotypes from eastern Polynesia (Leeward Society Isles, Tahiti, New Zealand Maori), and Ontong Java, are found near to the root of the hg C2a-M208 phylogenetic network (Supplementary Fig.S9). The PCA of this haplogroup and its sub-clades, including C2a1-P33, places the Leeward Society Islanders in closest overall proximity to individuals from the central northern Polynesian outlier of Ontong Java rather than those from Tonga and Samoa (Supplementary Fig.S10). The MRCA of the four target-sequenced Society Isles Y chromosomes provides an age of ~2,100\u2009BP for the hg C2a1-P33 (Supplementary Fig.S11, Supplementary TableS10B).",
            "Another Y chromosome hg, O3a\u2019i-P164, represents a possible ISEA contribution to male lineages among Polynesians and occurs in western Polynesia at significant levels (35%). In the Leeward Society Islands O3a\u2019i-P164 has a frequency of 11% (Supplementary TableS9B). Seven of the eight individuals belong to the O3i-B451 clade, which so far has only been identified among Austronesian speakers in ISEA39,40. All of these seven also typed positive for the downstream B450 marker and share an MRCA at ~5,700\u2009BP with a Sama-Bajaw individual from Sulawesi (Supplementary Fig.S11, Supplementary TableS3). They also carry a rare triplication event at DYS385, which is present among individuals, not genotyped beyond the ancestral positions of O3\u20327-M122 and O3\u20326-M324, from New Zealand (Supplementary TableS3), western Polynesia, Tikopia (southern Polynesian outlier) and Fiji (southern Melanesia)17,41. These individuals, therefore, likely belong to hg O3i.",
            "The Y chromosome diversity of the Leeward Society Isles is completed by hg O1-M119 and hg O6a-JST002611, which are prevalent in Taiwanese aborigines and East Asia42, respectively, and hg S2a-P79 (formerly K3-P79) (see Supplementary Fig.S11and its legend online, Supplementary TableS9B). The latter occurs on average at a frequency 6% in eastern Polynesia, western Polynesia, and Ontong Java (central northern Outlier). The available high-resolution STR data place the S2a-P79 haplotypes of the Leeward Society Isles in close proximity to those from New Zealand Maori and Ontong Java (Supplementary Fig.S12).",
            "The genomes of contemporary Polynesian-speaking groups appear to be a mosaic of components derived from the coming together of long-diverged sources from ISEA and the region of northern Melanesia/New Guinea13,14,25. How this came about is the subject of considerable debate9,11,12,30. Our haplotype-based analysis of high-density autosomal SNPs indicates that, for the ancestors of the Leeward Society Isles, most of this admixture occurred during a period spanning ~1,200\u20131,700\u2009BP. These genetic dates are nearly identical to those of a previous analysis that used a different method and amalgamated haplotype data from western (Tonga) and outlier (Rennell, Bellona and Tikopia) Polynesia25. They contrast with older dates obtained using different data sets and methods, which vary from ~7,000\u2009BP to ~2,700\u2009BP13,14,43. The method used here has been demonstrated to accurately identify known historical admixture events during the past 2,000 years38,44, but it is also possible that other analytical approaches may provide insights into a different part of the genealogical process.",
            "The presence of this demographic signal in the data from the Leeward Society Isles is important, since it is consistent with archaeological evidence for a late settlement model for eastern Polynesia ~950\u2009BP, and, therefore, the linguistic sub-grouping of Wilson32(Fig.1b). The substantial body of linguistic evidence supporting this sub-grouping includes over 200 lexical and grammatical innovations that are shared between the languages of eastern Polynesia and the central northern outliers (Luanguia, spoken on Ontong Java, Takuu, Nukumanu and Nuguria). Moreover, these innovations are stepwise and directional in nature, a pattern that is only consistent with a west-to-east movement of people, tracing the origins of eastern Polynesians to central northern outlier Polynesia, rather than Samoa32,33. The principal component analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction of the Polynesian mtDNA B4a1a1 sub-groups and C2a1-P33 paternal lineages (Supplementary FigsS8\u2013S10,S12), are consistent with this linguistic evidence for the recent settlement of eastern Polynesia from the central northern outliers.",
            "A further important contribution to the debate on Polynesian origins is the partitioning of northern Melanesian ancestry into both sides of the admixture episode taking place ~1,200\u20131,700\u2009BP in the ancestors of the Leeward Society Islanders (Fig.3). In particular, the contribution of ~8% of this ancestry to the side containing the ISEA sources is significant, because it suggests an earlier episode of admixture affecting the population ancestral to the Leeward Society Islanders. This result is robust to analysis by subsets of the data (Supplementary Fig.S7), but it is not possible to determine how and when this northern Melanesian ancestry entered into the ancestral gene-pool of the Leeward Society Islanders. It, therefore, remains feasible that, for some groups of Austronesian speaking migrants from ISEA, genetic admixture accompanied cultural interaction during the formative period of the LCC in the Bismarck archipelago ~3,450\u20133,250\u2009BP8,15, which precedes the settlement of southern Melanesia and western Polynesia by at least 200 years3,45.",
            "The position of the Kankanaey as the closest group to the Leeward Society Islanders in the outgroupf3allele-sharing plots (Supplementary Figs3and4), while not making any significant contribution to their genomes in the GLOBETROTTER38(GT) results (Fig.3) is potentially very revealing. It is arguable that one or other result is misleading as an effect of severe genetic drift. However, this hypothesis requires the concurrent excess retention of either SNPs (shouldf3 results be taken at face value), or haplotypes (should we trust only GT), typical of those found in the Leeward Society Islands today, which is statistically unlikely. Alternatively, while the Kankanaey are indeed the single best remaining proxy for the ancestors of the Leeward Society Islanders, the \u2018Philippine 1\u2019 cluster is admixed with a genetically closer population for those ancestors (comparing to the Kankanaey). Specifically, although the \u2018Philippine 1\u2019 cluster has received extensive admixture with other groups, which lowers theirf3score, they retain the best proxy for the haplotypic variation found in the original ancestors of the Leeward Society Islanders. This hypothesis is preferred because the GT approach models the recipient population using donors who are reconstructed rather than observed, allowing for subsequent admixture in the donor groups38.",
            "Within the geographical context of the Philippines, the GT results make sense because the populations making up the other three Philippines clusters are all located in mountainous regions and have languages that are either relics or indicate long-term isolation46,47. In contrast, the ancestors of the demographic expansion that led to the settlement of Polynesia are anticipated to be part of a recent seafaring tradition. This necessarily would have been based in the coastal regions and could be related to pre-existing trading networks within ISEA that already had links to Melanesia (see Donohue and Denham48and comments for a discussion of this subject). In this respect, it is interesting to note that the age of the most recent common ancestor of the Y chromosome haplogroup O3i-B451 (5,900\u20138,100\u2009BP, Supplementary TableS10B), proposed as a marker for the expansion of Austronesian speaking people throughout ISEA40, exceeds the proposed timing for the transfer of the Neolithic from Taiwan (4,200\u2009BP)11.",
            "Within the Society Islands themselves, maternally-inherited mitochondrial DNA lineages are strongly biased towards variants thought to be associated with the dispersal of Austronesian speakers (96% B4a1a1, Supplementary TableS9A). The best candidate for a contribution from the Austronesian speaking diaspora of ISEA to the male lineages of the Leeward Society Islands is haplogroup O3i-B451. However, it contributes less than 10% to the Leeward Society Islands paternal lineages (Supplementary TableS3). The majority of Y chromosome lineages have proposed ancestral associations with modern Papuan groups (C2a1-P33 and S2a-P79, Supplementary TableS9B)13,17. This sex bias holds across Polynesia and is observed as far back as Island Southeast Asia49, and may have resulted from the practice of exogamy and matrilocal post-marital residence among early Austronesian speaking groups50. A sex bias is also reflected in the nuclear genomes of Austronesian speakers and appears to be a characteristic of the Pacific region as a whole25,51.",
            "In conclusion, the picture of Polynesian origins emerging from the present study is one of a more complex demographic history than that originally envisioned in the phylogenetic model of cultural evolution12. The results presented here provide support for models based on inter-connectivity among, and within, the different parts of the Pacific, rather than their relative isolation8,9. The new data concur with a late chronology for the settlement of eastern Polynesia, which fits better with the linguistic arguments and haploid data linking this region to the northern central Polynesian outliers. With respect to the ultimate origin of the Island Southeast Asian ancestry found in the Leeward Society Isles, the results indicate a significant role for the lowland region of the Philippines, as predicted by Johann Reinhold Forster in his seminal comparative study of languages conducted more than two hundred and forty years ago.",
            "Thirty-six samples from the Leeward Society Islands were previously reported for Y chromosome genotypes52and 44 new samples are reported here, making a total of 81 male individuals from three islands: Bora Bora (n=\u200914), Rai\u2019atea (n=\u200936), Taha\u2019a (n=\u200931). In addition, 49 male Maori individuals sampled in New Zealand are reported for Y chromosome genotypes (Supplementary TableS1A). All samples were collected with informed consent and with the approval of the institutional review boards at the University of Colorado, U.S.A., and La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of the collaborating institutions.",
            "The DNA extracts of 81 Leeward Society Islanders (Supplementary TableS1A) were genotyped for membership of mitochondrial haplogroups typical of eastern Polynesia53\u201355. Nomenclature followed that of Phylotree.org, mtDNA tree Build 1756(Supplementary TableS2). This resulted in 78 individuals allocated to the hg B4a1a1 and three individuals to hg Q. The control region (nps 57\u2013372 and nps 16024\u201316526) was sequenced for 36 samples that could not be allocated to the known sub-clades of these two haplogroups, and 25 samples were further selected for complete mitochondrial genome sequencing. Using information from the full sequences, additional nucleotides were typed by Sanger sequencing to complete the haplogroup assignment.",
            "The 25 newly generated complete mtDNA sequences were merged with published data (see Supplementary TableS4), and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach in BEAST 1.8.457used to analyse two data sets comprising genomes belonging to hgs B4a1a1 (n\u2009=\u2009442) and M29/Q (n=\u2009111), respectively (Supplementary TableS4). The data sets were partitioned into the D-loop, rRNA genes, and first, second, and third, codon positions of the 13 protein-coding genes. Each data subset was assigned an independent model of nucleotide substitution, selected using the Bayesian information criterion in PartitionFinder58. Four demographic models for the tree prior were compared: constant size, exponential growth, logistic growth, and Bayesian skyride coalescent59, together with two models of rate variation across lineages: strict clock and uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock60. Marginal likelihoods were calculated using path sampling with 25 power posteriors, with samples drawn every 2\u2009M MCMC steps across a total of 50\u2009M steps. For the B4a1a1 analysis, the best combination was a strict clock with a logistic growth coalescent model. For the M29-Q analysis, the combination of strict clock and Skyride model is reported because the demographic model showed a clear change in population size.",
            "To calibrate the estimate of the timescale, a normal prior for the mutation rate was specified (mean 2.14\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128mutations/site/year, standard deviation 2.87\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129)61. The posterior distributions of parameters, including the genealogy, were estimated using MCMC sampling. Samples were drawn every 5,000 steps over a total of 50\u2009M MCMC steps. To check for convergence, each analysis was run in duplicate. After checking for acceptable MCMC mixing, the samples from the two runs were combined. Sufficient sampling was checked by computing the effective sample sizes of all parameters, which were found to be greater than 200.",
            "To make a principal component analysis of the haplogroup B4a1a data, 442 complete Polynesian and Melanesian mtDNA genomes used for the BEAST analysis (Supplementary TableS4) were combined with the additional complete or partially complete mtDNA sequences from Melanesia54(n=\u2009378), Hawaii55(n=\u2009159), New Zealand Maori53(n=\u200920), and the remaining hg B4a1a1 haplotypes from Leeward Society Islands (n=\u200955). Haplotypes were assigned to sub-clades of the hg B4a1a by the HaploGrep2 software62and manual inspection of sequences. The resulting haplogroup frequencies were used to produce a population level PCA in R63(Supplementary Fig.S8).",
            "Eighty-one male individuals from the Leeward Society Islands were genotyped for Y chromosome haplogroup specific SNPs by Sanger sequencing in a hierarchical manner, including new branch-defining SNPs from sub-clades O3i-B451 and O3i-B450. Unless otherwise stated, all nomenclature follows that of Karmin,et al.39to avoid potential confusion. The Y chromosomes of nine individuals belonged to haplogroups typical of Europeans (G, J, and R) and were not subject to further analysis. In addition, the Y chromosomes of 49 Maori males sampled in New Zealand were genotyped (Supplementary TableS1A). These samples were also hierarchically tested to a level of phylogenetic resolution equivalent to the main haplogroup level in the Leeward Society Islanders (Supplementary TableS3).",
            "The 72 Leeward Society Isles samples with non-European Y chromosomes, together with the 49 Maori samples, were further genotyped for 23 Y chromosome short tandem repeats (Y-STRs; Supplementary TableS3). After merging with comparative data from other sources16,17,39,41,42and excluding individuals with partial results, this produced a data set of 15 microsatellites and these were used it to construct phylogenetic networks of hgs C2a-M208 and K*-M9 using the reduced median algorithm with the software Network 4.6.1.1 software64(Fluxus-Engineering). The same 15 microsatellites occurring on the C2a-M208 background were used to perform PCA in R63, in order to examine the relationship of eastern, western and outlier Polynesia populations for this key haplogroup within Polynesian Y chromosome diversity (Supplementary Fig.S10).",
            "Next, seven individuals belonging to hgs C2a1-P33 (n=\u20094), K-M9 (n=\u20091), O3i-B450 (n=\u20091) and O6a-JST002611 (n=\u20091) were selected for target-capture re-sequencing using the BigY service (Gene By Gene Ltd) (Supplementary TableS1A). The paired-end reads were mapped to the GRCh37 human reference sequence. The reconstruction and rooting of the phylogeny of the seven samples from the Leeward Society Islands used 56 sequences published in Karmin,et al.39and 17\u2009hg\u2009O individuals from the 1000 Genome Project65(Supplementary TableS5). After filtering the data, the overlap between the data set was extracted and the \u2018re-mapping filter\u2019 based on modeling the poorly mapped regions was applied, as described in Karmin,et al.39. This resulted in 6.2 Mbp of usable sequence of the non-recombining male-specific Y chromosome region, and sites with minimum 95% call rate were used in the analysis.",
            "A Bayesian phylogenetic approach in BEAST57was used to analyse a final data set comprising 7669 SNPs from these 80 individuals. To correct for ascertainment bias, we added constant sites corresponding to the nucleotide composition across the remainder of the chromosome. The four demographic models and other details of the settings used in the MCMC analyses matched those used for analyses of mtDNA. The best-fitting model was exponential growth, which had a log Bayes factor of 8.079 compared with the next-best model (Bayesian skyride). To calibrate the estimate of the timescale, a mutation rate of 8.71\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210mutations/site/year66was specified.",
            "A set of 713,014 SNPs was screened using the HumanOmniExpress-24 BeadChip array in 30 individuals from the Leeward Societies Isles (Supplementary TableS1A). Twenty-six samples yielded high genotyping success rates (<5% missing genotypes), and 686,565 autosomal SNPs, with less than 5% missing data, were kept for further analyses. Inference of cryptic relationships between samples was performed using KING v. 1.467and no first-, second- or third-degree relatives were detected. A single sample clustered together with Europeans in the fineSTRUCTURE37run (see below), and was excluded from all population level analyses (Supplementary TableS1B).",
            "The study dataset was produced by merging newly generated Societies data with samples from mainland and ISEA, Melanesia, and Polynesia44,68\u201373, and with 25 random samples from multiple large continental reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project65(Fig.1a, Supplementary Table1B). Two independent datasets were produced. Firstly, a dataset comprised of 299,998 SNPs (after excluding SNPs with more than 5% missing data) from 570 samples was used for haplotype-based (fineSTRUCTURE, FS, and GLOBETROTTER38, GT) analyses,f3andFISstatistics. FS/GT requires a much higher density of SNP coverage, which was not possible to achieve while keeping samples from Hudjashov,et al.44due to the overlap between the different genotyping arrays used. Secondly, a dataset comprised of 92,972 SNPs (after excluding SNPs with more than 5% missing data) from 739 samples including those from Hudjashov,et al.44was used for genotype-based analyses only (ADMIXTURE35,f3,FISand PCA) (Supplementary TableS1B). For PCA and ADMIXTURE, only unlinked SNPs with R2<\u20090.2 were kept; 57,825 SNPs passed this criterion.",
            "Although there is a substantial overlap between the two datasets used here (including populations from East and Southeast Asia, Philippines, Indonesia and Melanesia) some important differences need to be mentioned. The dataset used for the FS and GT analyses does not include samples from Taiwan, Tonga, Samoa and Tahiti. These four populations are, therefore, only in the dataset used for allele-frequency based analyses. However, the Kankanaey of northwestern Luzon in the Philippines are proposed as a proxy for early Austronesian speakers from Taiwan71. Polynesian populations from Hudjashov,et al.44(Tonga, Samoa and Tahiti) were further controlled for the presence of cryptic relatedness between samples as described above by using the full SNP dataset from the original publication. In addition to the previously reported lack of first-degree relatives44, no other second- or third-degree relatives were found.",
            "Maximum likelihood estimates of the ancestry of individuals were obtained with ADMIXTURE v. 1.3035. Following Cox,et al.74, fifty randomly seeded runs were performed for each number of ancestral populations (K=\u20092 toK=\u200915), and the results for eachKwere summarized with CLUMPP v. 1.1.275. Runs with symmetric similarity coefficient\u2009>\u20090.9 were assigned to the same modal solution, and individual ancestry proportions were averaged across runs belonging to the same mode. The most frequent modal solution is reported.",
            "Autosomal PCA was performed with the smartpca function of EIGENSOFT v. 3.076with no outlier removal step.FIS(a measure of inbreeding) was calculated in Genepop v. 4.7.077.",
            "A series off3tests were performed with ADMIXTOOLS v. 4.136. Firstly, standardf3statistics were used as a formal test for admixture between all possible combinations of populations in the comparative dataset. Secondly, the outgroupf3test was implemented as a measure of the shared branch length between each of Polynesian groups and all other populations. For outgroupf3, the Yoruba population (YRI) from Africa was employed as the outgroup.",
            "To assess the potential bias introduced by two different SNP subsets and sample clustering procedures used here,f3andFISwere calculated as follows: (a) using the dataset ofca93k SNPs and 739 samples (with data from Hudjashov,et al.44) and the original population affiliation; (b) using a dataset ofca300k SNPs and 570 samples (without data from Hudjashov,et al.44) and the original population affiliation; (c) as per the approach outlined in (b), but using FS-based population grouping (see below and Supplementary TableS1B).",
            "In order to take advantage of the benefits gained from including linkage information when working with high-density genetic data, we employed the fineSTRUCTURE (FS)37, CHROMOPAINTER37and GLOBETROTTER (GT)38framework. Genotypes were first phased with SHAPEIT v. 278using the HapMap phase II b37 recombination map79. Sample were assigned to genetic groups using fineSTRUCTURE v. 2 with default parameters; 7.5\u2009M MCMC iterations were performed in total. The population dendrogram produced by FS was manually inspected and samples were assigned to 21 individual groups.",
            "After excluding a single Leeward Society Isles sample with a very high proportion of European ancestry, we inferred admixture with GT using the remaining combined Societies sample set (n=\u200925). To gain insight into the admixture variance within the Leeward Society Islands, we performed additional GT runs using the individual clades of the FS dendrogram. For the latter approach, only clades with a minimum of five samples were included, and in one case (\u2018Societies 3\u2019) the clade was amalgamated with its closest direct neighbor to pass the sample-size threshold. In total, 20 out of 25 samples were used in the individual GT runs. GT analysis was performed following the \u2018full\u2019 algorithm protocol38,44, where each recipient Society genome could copy chunks from the genomes of all other non-Societies donor clusters. One hundred bootstraps were used to assess the statistical significance of the admixture event and uncertainty of the inferred dates. Admixture dates were converted to years using the formula (x+\u20091) * 2838, wherexis the number of generations since the admixture event and the generation interval is 28 years80.",

            "From around 4,000 to 2,000 BC the forest-steppe north-western Pontic region was occupied by people who shared a nomadic lifestyle, pastoral economy and barrow burial rituals. It has been shown that these groups, especially those associated with the Yamnaya culture, played an important role in shaping the gene pool of Bronze Age Europeans, which extends into present-day patterns of genetic variation in Europe. Although the genetic impact of these migrations from the forest-steppe Pontic region into central Europe have previously been addressed in several studies, the contribution of mitochondrial lineages to the people associated with the Corded Ware culture in the eastern part of the North European Plain remains contentious. In this study, we present mitochondrial genomes from 23 Late Eneolithic and Bronze Age individuals, including representatives of the north-western Pontic region and the Corded Ware culture from the eastern part of the North European Plain. We identified, for the first time in ancient populations, the rare mitochondrial haplogroup X4 in two Bronze Age Catacomb culture-associated individuals. Genetic similarity analyses show close maternal genetic affinities between populations associated with both eastern and Baltic Corded Ware culture, and the Yamnaya horizon, in contrast to larger genetic differentiation between populations associated with western Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya horizon. This indicates that females with steppe ancestry contributed to the formation of populations associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture while more local people, likely of Neolithic farmer ancestry, contributed to the formation of populations associated with western Corded Ware culture.",
            "The forest-steppe north-western Pontic region of the middle Dniester and Prut interfluve was a place of contact and exchange routes between human populations inhabiting the drainages of the Black and Baltic Seas from around 4,000 to 2,000 BC1. During this time, the region was occupied by forest-steppe populations attributed to the Eneolithic (3350\u20133200 BC)1and the succeeding Bronze Age groups associated with the Yamnaya - Pit Grave (dated to 3,100/3,050\u20132,800 BC)2, the Catacomb (2,600\u20132,200 BC), the Babyno (2,200\u20131,700/1,600 BC) and the Noua (1,600\u20131,200/1,100 BC) cultures3,4. Although there were cultural differences between these populations, they all shared a similar nomadic lifestyle, pastoral economy and barrow burial rituals5. Some of the rounded burial mounds founded by Eneolithic people were reused by the succeeding cultural entities of the Early Bronze Age1, while other kurgans shared a mix of characteristics from both the Late Eneolithic and the Early Bronze Age funeral rites1,4.",
            "According to some researchers6\u20139, the Yamnaya culture originated in the Volga-Ural interfluve and spread across the Pontic-Caspian steppe between 3,300\u20132,800 BC. This cultural expansion led to the development of a less homogenous group of cultural entities belonging to the so-called Yamnaya Cultural-Historical Area/Unity10,11, hereafter reffered to as \u2018the Yamnaya horizon\u201912. People associated with the eastern Yamnaya culture spread across the steppe to the east of Don River. With no settlements identified in this area, they were thought to be more mobile because of their supposed nomadic profile of economy stimulated by environmental conditions of Kuban \u2013 North Caspian steppes13. On the other hand, Yamnaya settlements were found more frequently in the forest-steppe Pontic regions, to the west of Don River, probably due to favorable environmental conditions12.",
            "One of the most widely debated issues, which emerged in connection to studies on the Yamnaya horizon, was the relationship between the people associated with the Yamnaya and the Central European final Neolithic cultures, in particular the Corded Ware culture (dated to 2800\u20132300 BC)14. Archaeological records point to some similarities between the Corded Ware culture and the steppe, including shared practices such as the barrow structures and burial rituals2. Adoption of a herding economy based on mobility through the use of wagons and horses, was also proposed as a common trait associated with both the Yamnaya and Corded Ware cultures12. These observations led some researchers to suggest a possible Yamnaya migration toward the Baltic drainage basin15or a massive westward expansion of the steppe pastoralist people, representing the \u201cbarrow culture\u201d, into the North European Plain12,16. However, specific burial customs of the Yamnaya people, such as the scarcity of grave goods, the presence of ochre, and the building of specific wooden roof or floor structures, generated opposing arguments emphasizing the significant differences between the Corded Ware and steppe cultures2.",
            "Recent ancient DNA (aDNA) studies suggest that the large-scale migration of steppe populations associated with the Yamnaya horizon contributed to the formation of the final Neolithic central European populations14,17,18. Moreover, people associated with the Yamnaya horizon have been shown to be an admixed population with ancestry from Eastern hunter-gatherers and Caucasus hunter-gatherers14,17,19,20. Ancient DNA data indicate that the Neolithic populations from Central Europe already had the \u2018Caucasus\u2019 genetic component from the eastern steppes around 2,500 BC. Presence of this genetic component was used as an argument for the expansion of people from the Pontic-Caspian region into the central Europe14,17. X chromosome sequence data suggest that it was primarily males who participated in these migrations21,22and contributed to the formation of the people associated with the Corded Ware culture14,17. Based on the X chromosome data obtained mainly from western Corded Ware-associated individuals, it was estimated that, for every female, ~4\u201315 males migrated from the steppe21. Subsequently, the Yamnaya genetic component spread across Bronze Age Europe and West Asia14.",
            "Although questions concerning the migrations of nomadic people have been addressed by a number of studies19,23,24, the contribution of mitochondrial lineages associated with the Yamnaya horizon to the formation of people associated with the Corded Ware culture from the eastern part of the North European Plain, especially from the region of modern Poland, remains contentious. To investigate the maternal relationship between these two groups, we generated complete mitochondrial genomes from the representatives of Late Eneolithic and Early Bronze Age populations from the north-western Pontic region, including Yamnaya groups and individuals associated with the Corded Ware culture from the eastern part of the North European Plain.",
            "Ancient DNA was extracted from the Corded Ware culture individuals excavated in south-eastern Poland (N\u2009=\u200912) and Moravia (N\u2009=\u20093). Late Eneolithic (N\u2009=\u20095) and Bronze Age human remains (N\u2009=\u200925) originated from western Ukraine and came from the Yampil barrow cemetery complex located in the north\u2013western region of the Black Sea. Bronze Age individuals were associated with different archaeological cultures, including Yamnaya (N\u2009=\u200914), Catacomb (N\u2009=\u20092), Babyno (N\u2009=\u20094) and Noua (N\u2009=\u20095).

Individuals associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture (from present day Poland and the Czech Republic) shared close maternal genetic affinity with individuals associated with the Yamnaya horizon while the genetic differentiation between individuals associated with the western Corded Ware culture (from present-day Germany) and the Yamnaya horizon was more extensive. This decreasing cline of steppe related ancestry from east to west likely reflect the direction of the steppe migration. It also indicates that more people with steppe-related ancestry, likely both females and males, contributed to the formation of the population associated with the eastern Corded Ware culture. Similarly, closer genetic affinity to populations associated with Yamnaya horizon can be observed in Baltic Corded Ware groups, which confirms earlier indications of a direct migrations from the steppe not only to the west but also to the north, into the eastern Baltic region18,19,55. The mitochondrial data further suggests that with increased distance from the source populations of the steppe, the contribution of local people increase, which is seen as an increase of maternal lineages of Neolithic farmer ancestry in individuals associated with the western Corded Ware culture.",

Haplogroup X4 is rare among present day populations and has been found only in one individual each from Central Europe, Balkans, Anatolia and Armenia56,57. Moreover, we have reported mtDNA haplotypes that might be associated with the migration from the steppe and point to genetic continuity in the north Pontic region from Bronze Age until the Iron Age. These haplotypes were assigned to hgs U5, U4, U2 and W3. MtDNA hgs U5a and U4, identified in this study among Yamnaya, Late Eneolithic and Corded Ware culture-associated individuals, have previously been found in high frequencies among northern and eastern hunter-gatherers19,23,28,55,58,59. Moreover, they appeared in the north Pontic region in populations associated with Mesolithic (hg U5a)45, Eneolithic (Post-Stog) (hg U4)24, Yamnaya (hgs U5, U5a)24, Catacomb (hgs U5 and U5a)24and Iron Age Scythians (hg U5a)60, suggesting genetic continuity of these particular mtDNA lineages in the Pontic region from, at least, the Bronze Age. Hgs U5a and U4-carrying populations were also present in the eastern steppe, along with individuals from the Yamnaya culture from Samara region14,17, the Srubnaya23and the Andronovo from Russia14. Interestingly, hg U4c1 found in the Yamnaya individual (poz224) has so-far been found only in two Bell Beaker- associated individuals61and one Late Bronze Age individual from Armenia14, which might suggest a steppe origin for hg U4c1.

Hg U2e, reported for Late Eneolithic individual (poz090), was also identified in western Corded Ware culture-associated individual23and in succeeding Sintashta14, Potapovka and Andronovo23groups, suggesting possible genetic continuity of U2e1 in the western part of the north Pontic region.",

The W3a1 lineage was not identified in Neolithic times and, thus, we assume that it appeared in the steppe region for the first time during the Bronze Age. Notably, hgs W1 and W5, which predate the Bronze Age in Europe, were found only in individuals associated with the early Neolithic farmers from Star\u010devo in Hungary (hg W5)64, early Neolithic farmers from Anatolia (hg W1-T119C)23, and from the Sch\u00f6ningen group (hg W1c)61and Globular Amphora culture from Poland (hg W5)45.",

Furthermore, greater mtDNA differentiation between populations associated with the western Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya horizon points to an increased contribution of individuals with a maternal Neolithic farmer ancestry with increasing geographic distance from the steppe region, forming the population associated with the western Corded Ware culture.

            "Scythians were nomadic and semi-nomadic people that ruled the Eurasian steppe during much of the first millennium BCE. While having been extensively studied by archaeology, very little is known about their genetic identity. To fill this gap, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Scythians of the North Pontic Region (NPR) and successfully retrieved 19 whole mtDNA genomes. We have identified three potential mtDNA lineage ancestries of the NPR Scythians tracing back to hunter-gatherer and nomadic populations of east and west Eurasia as well as the Neolithic farming expansion into Europe. One third of all mt lineages in our dataset belonged to subdivisions of mt haplogroup U5. A comparison of NPR Scythian mtDNA linages with other contemporaneous Scythian groups, the Saka and the Pazyryks, reveals a common mtDNA package comprised of haplogroups H/H5, U5a, A, D/D4, and F1/F2. Of these, west Eurasian lineages show a downward cline in the west-east direction while east Eurasian haplogroups display the opposite trajectory. An overall similarity in mtDNA lineages of the NPR Scythians was found with the late Bronze Age Srubnaya population of the Northern Black Sea region which supports the archaeological hypothesis suggesting Srubnaya people as ancestors of the NPR Scythians.",
            "The Eurasian Steppe is a vast grassland region that stretches from the Carpathian foothills to Outer Mongolia. For millennia, the steppe was home to human populations that had a significant and long-lasting impact on the cultural history of the Eurasian continent. One such group that emerged at the beginning of the Iron Age had developed into an ethno-cultural agglomerate commonly referred to as the Scythians. The Scythians are best known from ancient Persian, Greek and Assyrian literary sources mainly for their nomadic warrior lifestyle, but they are also known to have actively practiced farming, pastoralism and may have been among the earliest peoples to master the art of horseback riding1.",

Most archaeology and history researchers suggest that the core territory of the tribes designated as \u201cScythians\u201d in historic literature of Antiquity covered the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the northern Black Sea (the North Pontic region, NPR) between the lower Danube and Don rivers4,5. Together with other contemporaneous groups they formed the \u2018Scythian horizon\u2019. These groups are collectively referred to by some researchers as Scytho-Siberians, who inhabited the steppe regions to the east of NPR Scythians and included Saka from Kazakhstan (7th\u20133rdcentury BCE)6,7and Pazyryks (5th\u20133rdcentury BCE) from the Sayano-Altai region of Siberia2,8. The forest-steppe zone of the core Scythian territory in the NPR was settled by populations with agro-pastoral economy, while the nomadic and semi-nomadic Scythian tribes occupied the steppe regions adjacent to the northern Black Sea. Archaeological studies of the Scythian and pre-Scythian period sites in the forest-steppe zone of the NPR pointed towards autochthonous origins of local agro-pastoral Scythian populations. Those groups which first emerged between the middle 7th\u20133rdcentury BCE, may have been formed on the foundation of pre-existing groups belonging to such cultures as Srubnaya (Timber Grave) and Thracian Hallstatt9. The origins of nomadic Scythians in the steppes of Central Asia10were supported by recent archaeological findings of elements of developed Scythian material culture in a series of kurgans in the western Sayan Mountains in southern Siberia dated to 9th\u20137thcentury BCE11.",

To date, only one complete mt genome of a Scythian individual from Russia has been published19.

The second group comprises haplotypes belonging to H, J, T, W and N1b, ultimately connected to the genetic package of the early Neolithic farmers44,46,47, and the third group includes A, D, M10 and F mt lineages considered to be of East Eurasian origin48,49,50,51.",
            "Representatives of the U5 haplogroup account for one third of the mt haplotypes identified in analyzed Scythians. These ultimately relate to West Eurasian hunter-gatherers, whose descendants extended throughout the European subcontinent and into East Eurasia from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age. We have combined the known diversity of the prehistoric U5 lineage from different sources19,45,46,47,52,53,54,55,56into a median network, which allowed for identification of candidate source populations contributing to the U5a diversity in NPR Scythians. Although the network approach is still limited by the small number of available samples, our results indicate that the source populations with the most closely related haplotypes are the Bronze Age Srubnaya (SRU) (1900-1200 BCE) and the earlier Yamnaya (YAM) (3300-2700 BCE) from the Ponto-Caspian region and Bronze Age populations from the Altai Mountains, such as Karasuk (1500-800 BCE). Diverse U5a-carrying populations of the steppe such as Yamnaya, Srubnaya and Scythians shared the nomadic lifestyle, with the economic foundations transforming from wild game exploitation in the Mesolithic to pastoralic animal husbandry in the Bronze Age. Furthermore, both Yamnaya and Srubnaya were part of the Kurgan culture phenomenon57with the Scythian cultural horizon being the most representative for the kurgan building tradition.",
            "The second group of identified mt genomes in the NPR Scythians is comprised of lineages that suggest associations of the NPR Scythians with the Neolithic European farming groups. Although the mt lineage composition of analyzed Scythians significantly differs from that seen in NEN and LBK groups (FST=\u20090.06,FST=\u20090.04, respectively, p\u2009>\u20090.05), particular lineages such as J1c2, T2b, H/H5, H, W and N1b1a ultimately go back to the earliest European farmers. Lineages of J1c, H5 and T2b belong to the Neolithic farming package of mtDNA haplogroups which have been found in most Neolithic and Bronze Age European populations19,44,47,55,58. Noteworthy, individuals belonging to the N1b1a have been found in the Neolithic Anatolia19,59, but the lineage has not appeared in any other Eurasian Neolithic, Bronze or Iron Age populations to date. Therefore, the presence of N1b1a in Scythians could be attributed to population migrations along the southern boundaries of the Ponto-Caspian region60.",
            "Mitochondrial lineages T2b, W3a and J2b1a6 have been identified in representatives of the Bronze Age groups such as Srubnaya (T2b, J2b1a, H5)19, Sintashta (J2b1a, J1c)55, Yamnaya (W3a and T2b)47,61and Mezhovskaya (J2b1a)55along with East European Eneolithic Trypillian culture (T2b)62, suggesting genetic continuity of these lineages from at least the Bronze Age or even Neolithic times in NPR region. This is further supported by published data19which showed that almost one fifth of the genetic makeup of the Late Bronze Age Srubnaya people of the Ponto-Caspian region is of the Early European Farmer or Anatolian Neolithic ancestry possibly resulting from the admixture of populations related to Early European Farmers and Yamnaya. Thus, if the NPR Scythians are the descendants of populations related to Srubnaya, the origin of the identified farming lineages would likely be within the steppe/forest-steppe region between the NPR and southern Ural. According to previous genomic studies47,55the CWC people are likely to have arisen from Yamnaya background. Thus, genetic affinities of the NPR Scythians to the Yamnaya people might also explain their close genetic similarity to the CWC reflected in PCA andFSTresults. Close genetic relations of the NPR Scythians and Srubnaya are supported by theFSTanalyses revealing no significant differences between these two populations (Figs 3and4,Supplementary Table S5). AMOVA further corroborated these results showing that the combination of Scythians and Srubnaya results in the lowest genetic variability among populations in a group and the highest variability between groups (Supplementary Table S6). Our results support the archaeological interpretations concerning the origin of the Scythians. One of the versions of this theory suggests that the Srubnaya people have migrated in several waves from the Volga-Ural region to the NPR during the second half of the second millennium BCE where their descendants gave rise to the Scythians around the 7thcentury BCE63.",
            "The third group of lineages identified in the NPR Scythians is derived from East Eurasian ancestry. Since, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of agricultural subsistence in East Eurasian Scythians, these lineages should be considered to be genetic components associated with nomadic populations. Mitochondrial haplogroups such as A, D and F have already been found in samples from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age southern Siberia and the Altai7,14,15,16,18,55,64,65,66,67. Notably, haplogroup M10 found among Scythians from Glinoe, is present not only in far East Asia but also in modern populations of the Altai68. Among ancient populations, the M10 lineages have been found in Chinese specimens from southern Xinjiang48(8th-1stcentury BCE) and Xiongnu69(3rdcentury BCE). Furthermore, haplogroup M have been identified in Pleistocene individuals from western Europe but it is thought that these lineages disappeared due to bottleneck effect in the Last Glacial Maximum56. Haplogroup H8c, identified in the NPR Scythians likely belongs to East Eurasian lineages as well. Sequence analysis of 830 modern Eurasian mt genomes suggested a distinct phylogeographc history for H8, with a clustering of Near Eastern and Central Asian haplotypes of H8 and a pronounced presence of carriers of H8c in the Altai region70. It was further hypothesized that the distribution of this lineage could have been facilitated by nomadic migrations along the NPR coast70. Although our PCA analysis showed Altai Pazyryk (SCA) to be distant from the NPR Scythians (SCU) (Fig. 2), it must be emphasized that the presence of haplogroups A and H8c in the analyzed population connects NPR Scythians to the Altai and identifies this region as a possible source of these East Eurasian mt lineages. The only Scythian mt genome from southern Urals published thus far also belonged to an East Eurasian lineage, G2a19. The Y chromosomal lineage (R1a1a1b2a2a) reconstructed for this individual was supposedly characteristic for members of the Srubnaya culture19which additionally supports our conclusions concerning close genetic links between Scythians and people related to the late Bronze Age Srubnaya.",
            "Previous analyses of mtDNA HVRI sequence data from Scythians inhabiting Rostov-on-Don region in eastern NPR also resulted in the identification of East Eurasian lineages, such as D13. Moreover, mt lineage D4j2 identified in the individual SCY006 was shown to have been dominant in the Pazyryk culture from Altai and Inner Mongolia (4th-2ndcentury BCE)7,14,16,17,18. The presence of East Eurasian mt lineages supports those archaeological theories that acknowledge the influence of an East Eurasian element in the formation of the Scythian horizon71,72.",
            "Scythians from Rostov-on-Don as well as Pazyryks from Altai and Inner Mongolia were carriers of mixed east and west Eurasian lineages, with the dominant presence of the latter at 62.5% and 53.3%, respectively7,13,14,15,16,17,18. Mitochondrial haplogroup analyses of the NPR Scythians from this study and those from Rostov-on-Don and Pazyryks from Altai and Inner Mongolia, reveal that, for the most part, the same lineages are found in all three groups and are often singularly represented in each group. Noteworthy, comparing the frequencies of east and west Eurasian haplogroups in all three groups of the Scythian horizon, an east-west mtDNA lineage cline is visible, for east Eurasian lineages going west-east is from 26.3% (in present study) through 37.5% (in Scythians from Rostov-on-Don) to 46.7% (in Pazyryks) with the opposite trend for west Eurasian lineages. Otherwise, mt lineage composition is comparable in all three groups of the Scythian horizon which supports their shared maternal genetic roots founded on the common east and west Eurasian substrate with an input from neighboring populations. The genetic influx of East Eurasian haplotypes might be the result of establishing relationships between migrants with European ancestry and women of east Eurasian origin as was previously proposed by66in case of Iron Age south Siberian populations. However, more detailed studies of autosomal DNA are needed to clearly resolve this issue.",
            "Sequence data from whole mt genomes indicate three potential mtDNA lineage ancestries of the NPR Scythians. The first component traces back to west Eurasian hunter-gatherers and is represented by the lineages belonging to subdivisions of haplogroup U5. The second component is composed of mt lineages connected with Neolithic farming expansion into Europe (H, J, T, W and N1b). The last ancestral mt lineage component is comprised of east Eurasian haplotypes belonging to D, A, F1, H8 and M10 which point to association of the NPR Scythians with east Eurasian populations, in particular from the Altai region. A comparison of NPR Scythian mtDNA lineages with other ancient groups suggests close genetic affinities with representatives of the Bronze Age Srubnaya population, which is in agreement with the archaeological hypothesis suggesting Srubnaya people as the ancestors of the NPR Scythians. However, to provide additional genetic support for this hypothesis data from nuclear genomes are needed.",

            "The Orcadian Neolithic has been intensively studied and celebrated as a major center of cultural innovation, whereas the Bronze Age is less well known and often regarded as a time of stagnation and insularity. Here, we analyze ancient genomes from the Orcadian Bronze Age in the context of the variation in Neolithic Orkney and Bronze Age Europe. We find clear evidence for Early Bronze Age immigration into Orkney, but with an extraordinary pattern: continuity from the Neolithic on the male line of descent but immigration from continental Europe on the female side, echoed in the genome-wide picture. This suggests that despite substantial immigration, indigenous male lineages persisted for at least a thousand years after the end of the Neolithic.",
            "Keywords:ancient DNA, Orkney, Neolithic, Bronze Age, genome-wide",
            "Orkney was a major cultural center during the Neolithic, 3800 to 2500 BC. Farming flourished, permanent stone settlements and chambered tombs were constructed, and long-range contacts were sustained. From \u223c3200 BC, the number, density, and extravagance of settlements increased, and new ceremonial monuments and ceramic styles, possibly originating in Orkney, spread across Britain and Ireland. By \u223c2800 BC, this phenomenon was waning, although Neolithic traditions persisted to at least 2500 BC. Unlike elsewhere in Britain, there is little material evidence to suggest a Beaker presence, suggesting that Orkney may have developed along an insular trajectory during the second millennium BC. We tested this by comparing new genomic evidence from 22 Bronze Age and 3 Iron Age burials in northwest Orkney with Neolithic burials from across the archipelago. We identified signals of inward migration on a scale unsuspected from the archaeological record: As elsewhere in Bronze Age Britain, much of the population displayed significant genome-wide ancestry deriving ultimately from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. However, uniquely in northern and central Europe, most of the male lineages were inherited from the local Neolithic. This suggests that some male descendants of Neolithic Orkney may have remained distinct well into the Bronze Age, although there are signs that this had dwindled by the Iron Age. Furthermore, although the majority of mitochondrial DNA lineages evidently arrived afresh with the Bronze Age, we also find evidence for continuity in the female line of descent from Mesolithic Britain into the Bronze Age and even to the present day.",
            "Benefiting from the tail end of the Holocene climatic optimum, the British Early Neolithic spread rapidly through Britain and Ireland from the south over 300 to 400 y from \u223c4050 BC (1\u20133). The settlers brought with them domesticated wheat, barley, sheep, and cattle, as well as knowledge of carinated bowl ceramics and causewayed enclosures (1\u20135), pointing to a likely source in northern France or Belgium.",
            "The Orkney Islands, lying to the north of the Scottish mainland, flourished during the Neolithic (3800 to 2500 BC), becoming a major cultural center (6\u20139). Underpinned by a successful farming economy and long-range contacts, the earliest permanent settlements were constructed in wood, followed by stone-built dwellings from 3300 cal. (calibrated) BC onward (9,10). The use of stone appears to have been a conscious design choice (9,11,12) and has resulted in an extraordinary level of archaeological preservation.",
            "While recent genome-wide studies (13) have demonstrated the extent and tempo of continental migration into Britain during the Beaker period, after 2500 BC, there has so far been little or no recognition of the archaeological implications of this for Orkney. The paucity of Beakers and associated material culture in the archaeological record has been taken as an indication that the cultural and population shifts occurring elsewhere in Britain at this time had little direct impact in Orkney (8,14\u201318) and indeed may have been locally resisted (6). As a result, Orkney has been seen to have developed along a largely insular trajectory during the second millennium BC.",
            "Significant changes in funerary practice did begin to emerge at this time, and research has concentrated on funerary remains. Barrow cemeteries, some of the largest in northern Britain, appeared in Orkney around the end of the third millennium BC. These earthen mounds contained multiple burials, added sequentially and most frequently comprising cremated remains in pits or stone-lined cists (18). Flat cist cemeteries were also in use for both inhumation and cremation burials, and often graves contained the remains of several individuals, but grave goods were infrequent.",
            "Until recently, the low visibility of settlement sites had led to the idea that this was a period of environmental and cultural recession (19). The balance has begun to be redressed through focused environmental analyses (20) and reports on settlements such as at Crossiecrown (9) and Tofts Ness (21). Opportunities to correlate settlement and funerary remains are very rare, and few sites extend across the Neolithic and Bronze Age (BA) periods, making it difficult to draw a coherent picture of change over time. In this respect, the ongoing investigations at the Links of Noltland (LoN) are providing valuable new insights.",
            "The LoN is located on Westray, the northwesterly most island of the Orkney archipelago. The exceptional conditions have preserved extensive settlement and cemetery remains dating from at least 3300 cal. BC up to about 500 BC (22\u201325). While no direct overlap has yet been detected between Neolithic and BA phases of settlement, there is no evidence for a major hiatus in occupation. The BA settlement, distinguished on architectural grounds and dating from \u223c2500 to 1200 cal. BC, includes three separate conglomerations of domestic and ancillary buildings, which, like their Neolithic counterparts, were spread across a contemporary farmed landscape. Built from a mix of stone and earthen banks, often arranged in pairs, they were in use until at least 1200 cal. BC. A cemetery located among these settlements, used between at least 2150 BC and 850 BC, comprised >50 burials, including >100 individuals. Both cremation and inhumation were practiced, at times contemporaneously, and multiple burials within a single grave were common. Material evidence of the \u201cBeaker complex,\u201d seen across mainland Britain, is scant in Orkney; a few sherds from two Beaker vessels were recovered from the wider area (19), dated to \u223c2265 to1975 cal. BC, but no further pottery or recognizable artifacts have been found in association with the cemetery or settlement.",
            "The study of ancient genomes has shown that across much of Europe, including mainland Britain, the arrival of Metal Age culture was accompanied by the introduction of new ancestry from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe and a predominance of Y-chromosomal haplogroup R1b-M269 (13,26\u201331). We investigated genomic variation in the Orkney archipelago within the context of this framework. Genome-wide SNP (single\u2013nucleotide polymorphism) capture and shotgun data were available from 21 Early Neolithic Orcadians (13,32), but only one from the BA (13). To investigate BA Orkney, we generated whole-genome shotgun sequence data from 22 samples from the LoN cemetery and analyzed them alongside these published data. We also included new data from three Iron Age (IA) samples from the multiperiod ritual complex and cemetery site of Knowe of Skea (KoS), on the west coast of Westray, and 12 further prehistoric samples from Scotland and northern England.",
            "We present shotgun genome data from 29 samples from prehistoric Scotland and eight from northern England: 22 from the BA LoN in Westray, Orkney, dating to \u223c1400 to 1700 BC (LoN); three from the IA KoS in Westray, Orkney, dating to the first two centuries AD; one from IA Milla Skerra (MS), Unst, Shetland; one from IA High Pasture Cave (HPC), Isle of Skye in the Hebrides (33); one from Neolithic Strath Glebe (SG), also Skye; a Pictish sample from Rosemarkie Cave (RC), Black Isle in northern Scotland, dating to 430 to 630 AD; a Beaker burial sample from Low Hauxley (LH), Northumberland; three BA samples from West Heslerton (WH), North Yorkshire; two IA samples from Knapton Wold (KW), North Yorkshire; and two IA samples from Carsington Pasture Cave (CPC), Derbyshire. Whole-genome coverage varied greatly from 0.0007\u00d7 to 0.8207\u00d7. We undertook genome-wide analysis on samples above 0.009\u00d7, with samples averaging 0.194\u00d7. All samples passed contamination tests (Table 1,SI Appendix, Table S1,Dataset S1AandB, andSI Appendix, Fig. S1). We analyzed these in the context of genome data from Early Neolithic Orkney (n= 21) (13,32) and Neolithic, Chalcolithic (CA), and BA Europe and 1,856 new mitogenomes from modern Orkney (n= 1,356) and Shetland (n= 500) (Datasets S1CandS2).",

            "ADMIXTURE analysis (Fig. 1A) showed that the samples from BA Orkney closely resembled other northern European BA people in their overall genome-wide profiles and were highly distinct from Neolithic Orkney samples, which resembled more our Neolithic sample from Skye and other British and Irish Neolithic samples. Neolithic samples all lacked the CHG (\u201cCaucasus hunter-gatherer\u201d) component (in blue) that most clearly signals admixture from Pontic-Caspian Steppe pastoralists (34). The CHG fraction in Orkney (both BA and IA) is somewhat higher (\u223c40%) than in other Scottish CA and EBA (Early Bronze Age) samples but within the wide range of values for England (Fig. 1AandSI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Modern Orcadians have an even higher fraction of the CHG component, reflecting medieval Norse settlement, estimated from modern genome-wide surveys at \u223c20 to 25% (35) and \u223c25 to 30% of modern Y chromosomes (36,37). Geographical and chronological trends are portrayed more clearly in the PCA (principal component analysis) (Fig. 1BandSI Appendix, Fig. S3). LoN BA samples broadly clustered with northern and central European Bell Beaker, CA, and BA samples, and KoS IA samples fell within the same broad cluster.",

            "D-statistics quantify shared genetic drift among genomes and can thus also be used to estimate the degree of similarity among individuals. We calculated symmetryD-statistics by comparing potential outlier samples (as noted in the ADMIXTURE analysis) to the rest of the LoN using the formD(Mbuti, Test; Potential Outlier, LoN). The LoN samples consistently formed a clade, indicating that they were statistically indistinguishable from each other (SI Appendix, Fig. S4AandDataset S1D). WithD-statistics of the formD(Mbuti, LoN; European BA, European BA), after closest matches to the slightly older published Lop Ness BA sample from Sanday, Orkney, the most common significant similarities were with British Bell Beaker complex (BBC) samples, the Scottish BA, and Orkney KoS IA, as well as to a few continental individuals such as French BBC and the Dutch BA (SI Appendix, Fig. S4BandDataset S1E). Outgroup-f3 statistics showed a similar pattern, with LoN closest to eastern British, Welsh, Irish, and northwest European BBC and BA samples, albeit with overlapping errors across European BBC and BA samples (Fig. 1CandSI Appendix, Fig. S5A). This indicates that the Orkney BA was most likely settled via the British mainland (possibly the eastern side) by people who arrived in Britain during the Beaker period.",

            "The softwareqpAdm(38) summarizesf4-statistics (which are similar toD-statistics) in order to estimate the direction and magnitude of gene flow, or admixture, from one population to another. We modeled admixture fractions withqpAdmusing the three major components demonstrated by ADMIXTURE; Steppe, \u201cAnatolian Neolithic Farmer\u201d (ANF), and \u201cWestern Hunter-Gatherer\u201d (WHG) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6andDataset S1F). The LoN comprised \u223c55% of their ancestry from the Steppe, 33% from ANF, and 12% from WHG, broadly similar to published BA samples from across Britain (13).",
            "The populations that contributed to the LoN population were likely admixtures of those three components. To identify more proximal sources for the LoN, we modeled various potential Early Neolithic versus Late Neolithic/EBA source populations (Table 2). The Orcadian BA samples could be plausibly modeled as \u223c4 to 7% local Neolithic and \u223c93 to 96% Scottish BBC populations, but also as 1 to 5% local Neolithic and \u223c95 to 99% French BBC populations or \u223c1% local Neolithic and \u223c99% Danish BA populations. Despite the uncertainty indicated by the SEs, these results clearly imply very high levels of replacement of the Neolithic people by people related to continental BBC immigrants by the EBA, with only \u223c5% assimilation at most of the local autosomal gene pool. However, by the time the descendants of the BBC immigrants reached Orkney, they appear to have lost their Beaker cultural affiliation, as reflected in the dearth of Beaker-associated material culture in Orkney (6).",
            "Putative BA and Neolithic ancestry of LoN MBA and Lop Ness EBA (13) samples modeled withqpAdm",
            "Only feasible and signi\ufb01cant results are displayed. The strong apparent similarity between the Orkney MBA LoN samples and the southern France BBC samples is likely not due to common ancestry but possibly due to the higher levels of Neolithic assimilation in the latter (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B); the reason for the similarity with the Danish BA is unclear.",
            "Thus, the picture from the genome-wide analyses suggests a substantial replacement of the Orcadian population between the Late Neolithic and the BA, similar to that seen in mainland Britain (13). However, there are striking and unexpected differences between the patterns displayed by the uniparental marker systems, which can illuminate in more detail how this process took place.",
            "Early Neolithic Orkney (n= 21) includes mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) characteristic of the European Neolithic, suggesting predominantly settlement from the western Neolithic but with a minor contribution from the Danubian Neolithic (SI Appendix, Section S5). By contrast, the BA LoN suite of lineages (n= 20) is very different (Datasets S1GandS2). There are a number of minor H lineages, including H39 (four individuals), H58a, H+195, and two individuals with H1n1. There are also two with J1c2a, three with T2a1b1a\u2014matching the EBA individual from Lop Ness (the only previously published BA Orkney sample) (13), two with T2b21, two with U5b2a3, one with K1a3a, one with K1a29a, and one with K1c2. Eight of these individuals (three of the H39 individuals, all three T2a1b individuals, one of the two U5b2a3 individuals, and the K1a3a individual) were part of a multiple burial, of which two were related (see below). The males from the multiple burial also all carried Y-chromosome haplogroup I2a1b-M423/I2a1b1-S185.",
            "The age and geographic distribution of the clusters to which most of the BA LoN lineages belonged suggest that most of them were not inherited from the local Neolithic but arrived later. Many are associated in ancient DNA studies with continental Corded Ware Culture, BBC, or BA populations (SI Appendix, Section S5). For example, T2a1b1 is seen in the German Corded Ware, whereas T2b21 matches German and Czech BBC lineages. While H39 and K1c2 lineages have not been seen in published ancient DNA data, the modern lineages are restricted to northern Europe and date to \u223c3000 BC and 2600 BC, respectively, again suggesting a source in the Corded Ware expansion across northern Europe at 2500 to 3000 BC. Several lineages, such as J1c2*, K1a3a, H1n1, H58a, and H+195, are harder to resolve, but their distribution is in each case consistent with a BBC arrival, although we cannot currently conclusively rule out a local Neolithic source. The IA KoS remains (n= 3) include two identical H1b lineages and one U5a1b1a, both of which can be attributed to either the BBC or the Corded Ware on the Continent.",
            "The lineage most likely to date to before the Beaker Age in Orkney, seen in two LoN individuals, is U5b2a3\u2009+\u200916319, which we name here U5b2a3b (Dataset S3). U5b2a3 dates to \u223c8500 BC and is seen in Early Neolithic individuals from both Scotland (13) and Wales (39), and so the Orkney individuals represent potential continuity from the British Neolithic into the BA. Intriguingly, U5b2a3b is also seen in one modern individual from the British Isles (40), as well as an individual from Virginia, United States (founded as a British colony), indicating potential continuity through to the present day. Indeed, with U5b2a* found in Neolithic Orkney (32) and Scotland (13) and, notably, Mesolithic Ireland (41) and U5b2a3 itself also seen in Neolithic Ireland (41), along with the presence of U5b2 lineages in modern Orkney and Shetland (Dataset S2), it is possible that some U5b2 lineages, including U5b2a3b, may signal some of the most ancient lineages surviving in present-day Britain and Ireland, potentially even from the local Mesolithic.",
            "There are 16 known Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplotypes from Neolithic Orkney, of which 14 appear to be well resolved (13,32). All 14 belong to haplogroup I2a, of which seven are I2a1b-M423, four are I2a1b1-S185, one is I2a2-S33, one is I2a2a1b-CTS10057, and one is I2a2a1a2-Y3679 (the remaining two are poorly resolved I and I2). In BA LoN, even though the majority of genome-wide and female lineages most likely arrived in Britain and Orkney with the BBC or BA, all but one of the nine Y-DNA lineages belong to haplogroup I2a1b-M423, with just one belonging to R1b-M269 (SI Appendix, Section S6andDataset S1H). We found four distinct haplotypes within I2a1b: I2a1b-M423, I2a1b1-S185, and the more derived I2a1b1a1b-A1150 and I2a1b1a1b1-A8742.",
            "This predominance of I2a1b-M423 is surprising because it is completely absent elsewhere in CA/BA Europe, where the Y-DNA landscape is heavily dominated by R1b-M269 (Figs. 2\u20134andSI Appendix, Figs. S13\u2013S15). For example, in a dataset of 21 BBC males from Britain, 20 carry the R1b-M269 lineage and only one I2a, which is on the distinct I2a2a-M223 lineage. If we include CA and EBA Britain and Ireland, 41 out of 43 males carried R1b-M269, two I2a2a-M223, and none I2a1b-M423.",

            "Thus, except for the single R1b-M269 lineage, all sampled LoN BA males carried a subset of the Neolithic Y-DNA pool. These are very unlikely to have been brought to Orkney by BBC or BA migrants from further south in Britain. Not only has I2a1b-M423 not been seen in the European BBC or BA, but it was a minority lineage even during the European Neolithic. Among 389 published male genomes from the European Neolithic, only 12% (47 of them) carry I2a1b-M423, of which 40% (19/47) are from Britain or Ireland (42), and most of those in Britain are from Orkney (Figs. 3and4). Even in Britain and Ireland, outside of Orkney most Neolithic Y-DNA lineages belong to haplogroup I2a2-S33 or I2a2a-M223 (Fig. 3), although, curiously, our Neolithic individual from Skye belongs to the very rare I2a2b-S154, seen elsewhere only in Middle Neolithic France (43). I2a1b-M423 seems to be largely restricted to western Neolithic Britain and Ireland, where it occurs rarely alongside I2a2a-M223, as well as I2a1a-CTS595 (41), which has not yet been found in Neolithic Britain.

We conclude that the I2a1b-M423 lineages at BA LoN had most likely persisted from the local Orcadian Neolithic and were not contributed to this population by mainland British Neolithic groups. By contrast, the two sampled males at the IA KoS site, also on Westray, belonged to the R1b-M269 lineage.",

In the Neolithic, I2a1b-M423 was largely distributed in an arc around the Atlantic fa\u00e7ade of Europe, from the western Mediterranean to the Baltic. Outside Britain, most I2a1b-M423 lineages are from Middle/Late Neolithic Spain and France, with one from Germany and a small number from Sweden, where, at a megalithic site on Gotland, all four genotyped males belonged to I2a1b-M423 (Fig. 4) (32). It is also present in several hunter-gatherers in northern and central Europe, including Mesolithic Ireland. This distribution, the molecular-clock age of the two major subclades (I2a1b1-S185 and I2a1b2-S392 both date to \u223c7 ka) (YFull YTree version 8.06.01, 27 June 2020;https://www.yfull.com/tree/), and evidence that the ancestral lineage survives today only in Iberia (YFull tree) suggest assimilation from hunter-gatherers during the spread of the Neolithic into southwest Europe, followed by Neolithic dispersal into northwest and northern Europe, although some further assimilation in northern Europe is also possible.",

This is a large decrease from Neolithic Orkney and also much lower than elsewhere in Neolithic, BBC, or BA Britain and northwest Europe (SI Appendix, Table S2). These results suggest a small, endogamous population.",
            "We estimated kinship using Relationship Estimation from Ancient DNA (READ) software (45), coupled with uniparental markers and the age-at-death osteoarchaeological profile. The READ analysis identified almost no evidence for close kinship. Even among the seven individuals in the multiple inhumation who passed the criteria for DNA analysis (out of 11), the only first- or second-degree relationship involved two full siblings: a brother and sister, where the former died in adolescence and the latter soon after birth. The siblings shared an identical, rare mtDNA haplotype (within H39), and the male carried the most common Y-DNA haplotype at the cemetery (I2a1b1-S185). An infant from outside of the multiple burial carried a slightly distinct lineage of mtDNA H39, but we could find no evidence of close kinship using READ (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A).",
            "The low Y-DNA diversity and multiple sharing of rare mtDNA haplotypes both suggest a small, close-knit community, notwithstanding the relatively recent arrival (within the previous millennium) of most of the mtDNAs from overseas. However, the most significant signal remains the contrast between the autochthonous male lineages versus higher-diversity nonlocal female lineages, pointing to ongoing patrilocal marriage patterns, not only in the BA but, by inference from the persistence of I2a1b-M423, at the end of the Neolithic too. We note that although the contrast between the largely indigenous Y-DNA and the largely continental mtDNA and autosomal fraction is very striking, a level of \u223c95% continental genome-wide ancestry could be achieved by the marrying out of indigenous men with immigrant women in only five generations, or 100 to 150 y, which the results suggest were followed by isolation and endogamy (SI Appendix, Section S3.10).",
            "We have investigated genomic variation in BA and IA Orkney and compared it with the available evidence for the preceding Orcadian Neolithic, in the context of Mesolithic, Neolithic, BA, and IA variation from across Europe. Both the mtDNA and Y-DNA variation of Neolithic Orkney point to settlement primarily from the Mediterranean/Rh\u00f4ne/Atlantic dispersal route, via the British mainland, in line with genome-wide analyses for Neolithic Britain as a whole (13,39). Although this process was largely one of colonization, we find some evidence for potential assimilation and survival of indigenous Mesolithic maternal lineages. The presence of an apparently ancient local branch of mtDNA haplogroup U5b complements genome-wide observations of hunter-gatherer assimilation in western Scotland (39) and Ireland (41).",
            "This study confirms that the drastic shift in the British population in the BA, evident in both the genome-wide (13) and mtDNA patterns, also occurred in Orkney. Orkney was largely resettled from the British mainland by people of substantially recent continental ancestry. Although this demographic shift may have taken place over centuries, it was likely sustained relatively unchanged into the IA; although we have analyzed only three IA samples, they all show a similar pattern.",
            "Unexpectedly, despite this wave of immigration, local Neolithic male lineages persisted well into the BA, at least in Westray. While we do see evidence for male newcomers, in the presence of a single R1b-M269 Y-DNA lineage (in an infant burial), the other males all carry the indigenous I2a1b-M423 lineage. This lineage survived in a single fifth or sixth century Pictish sample from Birsay, northwest Mainland (46), but is only seen in a single family (among 407 males tested) in Orkney today.",
            "The I2a1b-M423 lineage almost vanished elsewhere in western Europe after the end of the Neolithic. None are seen in post-Neolithic European archaeological remains. It is seen at only \u223c1% in modern Britain and is almost absent in most of modern western Europe, although one recent subclade of I2a1b2-S392 has undergone dramatic expansion with Slavic populations in the Balkans (Figs. 2\u20134andSI Appendix, Fig. S13) (47).",
            "A possible explanation can be found in the continuity, stability, and self-sufficiency of farming settlements, such as LoN. These successful household groups, while undoubtedly participating in an Orkney-wide Neolithic society, also developed strong local identities, manifested in locally variant art styles, material culture, architecture, and ritual activity. They may, for example, have pursued their own long-range contacts, as suggested, for example, by the importation of aurochs and local tomb art, distinctive within Orkney and most directly comparable with that found at Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne in Ireland, where patrilineal descent has recently also been inferred from genetic data (41). From a position of strength during the Neolithic, such settlements may have been better placed to mediate inward migration and to make specific choices with regards to the management of lineage.",
            "We propose that we may be seeing the surviving remnants of well-established Neolithic household groups in BA Orkney: a number of distinct male lineages that have persisted when almost the whole of the rest of the population (and genome) has been replaced. While the archaeological signs of these groups may not have been especially ostentatious, the persistence of their lineages for at least a thousand years beyond the point when the vast majority of male lineages elsewhere in Britain were replaced by newcomers might imply a more protracted and perhaps more negotiated process of assimilation than elsewhere, as well as pointing to much less insularity than has often been assumed for the Orcadian BA (25).",
            "There are several caveats to this suggestion. Firstly, we are describing the situation in one of the most remote parts of the Orkney archipelago and at a particular moment in time. It is a snapshot and may not be representative of Orkney as a whole. While the single Lop Ness sample (from another island in the archipelago) confirms the overall pattern of continental immigration, the individual is female and therefore provides no information on the male lineage. Further investigations can help to fill out the picture.",
            "Secondly, there are numerous cremation burials at the site for which DNA analysis cannot be carried out. Is it possible that newcomer R1b-M269 males were mostly cremated? This seems unlikely; substantial numbers of BBC and EBA inhumation burials have been analyzed from England and Scotland, and the males carried almost exclusively R1b-M269 Y-DNA lineages. However, even if this were the case, the persistence in inhumations of the I2a1b-M423 lineage, in the face of an almost 95% replacement at the genome-wide (and probably also the mtDNA) level, remains extraordinary.",
            "Within the European context, the Orkney BA stands in stark contrast as a location, at the northwestern extreme of the continent, where the majority of the genome was overwritten between the Late Neolithic and the end of the EBA but the male lineages somehow persisted. Even so, we can understand this phenomenon in terms of the same patrilocal marriage practices that we see throughout west Eurasia. The ancestral distribution in Orkney demonstrates deliberate marriage patterns involving local men and incoming women. This process of preferential assimilation seems likely to have continued for many generations, given the extent of replacement of the remainder of the Orcadian Neolithic genome.",
            "The existence of a powerful and likely strongly hierarchical strand in Neolithic society has been proposed on the basis of the discovery of an incestuous first-degree union at Newgrange in Ireland (41) and was prefigured by earlier analyses of Ireland and other megalithic cultures in both northwest and central Europe (32,48). Cassidy et al. (41) argue that it encompassed the whole of Ireland, adding that it may have incorporated the similar megalithic communities of Wales and Orkney, most likely originating in Brittany (1,49). I2a1b-M423 is seen in both Mesolithic and Neolithic Ireland, and the main cluster seen in Late Neolithic Ireland, I2a2a1a1-M284\u2014found in the putative elite lineage at Newgrange\u2014matches an Orcadian Neolithic lineage from the Isbister Chambered Cairn (\u201cTomb of the Eagles\u201d) on South Ronaldsay (Fig. 3andSI Appendix, Fig. S13) (13). Both our data from BA Orkney and the Neolithic circumcoastal distribution of the Y-chromosome I2a1b-M423 haplogroup lend further support to this suggestion. European Neolithic society, at one extreme (but hardly peripheral) edge of its distribution, may have been patrilineal, patrilocal, and hierarchical long before the arrival of the Beaker complex and (most likely) Indo-European speech (27,28,31,50).",
            "Our data suggest that Neolithic lineages persisted within particular farming households, which, although not obviously elite, appear to have retained control of specific landholdings over many generations. This linkage of lineage with specific place is strongly suggestive of preferential inheritance along the male line. The continuity which this engendered is likely to have contributed significantly to the longevity of settlements between the third and first millennia BC. The indigenous male lineages remained in place while their people, their culture, their language, and even their genomes were transformed to resemble more and more those of the European mainland from which the newcomers had come.",
            "Our findings both demonstrate EBA migration into Orkney and amplify the recognition that \u201cthe expansion of the Beaker complex cannot be described by a simple one-to-one mapping of an archaeologically defined material culture to a genetically homogenous population\u201d (51). They also highlight that population influx may have occurred even where few archaeological traces have been identified. This prompts a critical reassessment of the origins of Orcadian BA practices, which have hitherto been viewed either as insular development, imitative of distant elites, or the result of gradual filtering-in of influences. The circumstances surrounding the emergence of novel monument types such as barrows and burnt mounds, for example, will need to be reconsidered.",
            "If more widely borne out, these findings suggest that BA Orkney is likely to have seen regular and sustained migration, engaged in long-distance exchange networks, and adopted novel practices. The perseverance of Neolithic lineages\u2014and, potentially, identities\u2014into this period adds a further layer of cultural complexity, the implications of which remain to be fully explored.",
            "We describe the archaeological samples and materials and methods fully inSI Appendix. Briefly, we extracted DNA from 37 samples using existing protocols (33,52,53). We constructed and UDG (uracil\u2013DNA glycosylase) treated next-generation sequencing libraries (42,54,55), pooled equimolarly, and sequenced all libraries on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (100-bp, paired-end sequencing; Macrogen). We trimmed sequence reads of adapter sequences and merged them using AdapterRemoval (version 2.1.7) (56). We mapped reads to the human reference genome (UCSC [University of California Santa Cruz] hg19) and the human mitochondrial reference genome (the revised Cambridge reference sequence or rCRS,NC_012920.1) (57) using BWA aln (Burrows\u2013Wheeler alignment tool) (version 0.7.12-r1039) (58) and filtered for mapping quality (56,59). We examined molecular damage patterns to establish data authenticity and levels of mtDNA and whole-genome contamination. As expected from UDG-treated samples, observed damage patterns were minor (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). We carried out uniparental marker analysis and molecular sex determination (60) following established methods. We used GATK (version 3.8) to call pseudohaploid genotypes at known SNP positions, which were then merged with the Human Origins dataset (61), the 1000 Genomes Project data, and realigned published ancient samples (SI Appendix). We investigated population relationships between newly reported samples and other ancient and modern individuals using smartPCA and ADMIXTURE (version 1.3) (62), withDandfstatistics calculated using ADMIXTOOLS (63) to formally confirm relationships, and quantified admixture usingqpAdm(34). A list of published samples we used in analyses is inDataset S1I. We inferred kinship relationships using READ (45) and assessed ROH and effective population size with hapROH (44). We describe construction of Y-chromosome phylochronology for I2a and R1b-M269 inSI Appendix, Section S6 and Figs. S10\u2013S16. We extracted the modern mitogenomes from the whole-genome Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) for Orkney (64) and the VIKING study for Shetland (65).",

            "The Hmong-Mien (HM) and Sino-Tibetan (ST) speaking groups are known as hill tribes in Thailand; they were the subject of the first studies to show an impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs. male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation. However, HM and ST groups have not been studied in as much detail as other Thai\u00a0groups; here we report and analyze 234 partial MSY sequences (\u223c2.3\u2009mB) and 416 complete mtDNA sequences from 14 populations that, when combined with our previous published data, provides the largest dataset yet for the hill tribes. We find a striking difference between Hmong and IuMien (Mien-speaking) groups: the Hmong are genetically different from both the IuMien and all other Thai groups, whereas the IuMien are genetically more similar to other linguistic groups than to the Hmong. In general, we find less of an impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mtDNA vs. MSY variation than previous studies. However, there is a dramatic difference in the frequency of MSY and mtDNA lineages of Northeast Asian (NEA) origin vs. Southeast Asian (SEA) origin in HM vs. ST groups: HM groups have high frequencies of NEA MSY lineages but lower frequencies of NEA mtDNA lineages, while ST groups show the opposite. A potential explanation is that the ancestors of Thai HM groups were patrilocal, while the ancestors of Thai ST groups were matrilocal. Overall, these results attest to the impact of cultural practices on patterns of mtDNA vs. MSY variation.",
            "Subject terms:Population genetics, Evolutionary biology",
            "Thailand occupies the center of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) and shares borders with several countries: Laos and Myanmar in the North and West, Laos in the Northeast, Cambodia in the East, and Malaysia in the South (Fig.1). With a census size of ~68.61 million in 2018, there are 73 different recognized languages belonging to five different linguistic families: Tai-Kadai (TK, 89.4%), Austroasiatic (AA, 4.0%), Sino-Tibetan (ST, 3.2%), Austronesian (AN, 2.8%), and Hmong-Mien (HM, 0.2%) [1]. Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of modern humans in the area of Thailand since the late Pleistocene [2]. More recently, archaeogenetics studies indicate that modern AA-speaking groups in Southeast Asia (SEA) are descended from a dispersal of Neolithic farmers from southern China that occurred ~4000 years ago (kya) [3,4]. Archaeological and linguistic evidence supports the presence of AA people by at least 2.5\u2009kya, while a later expansion of the TK-speaking groups from southern China reached present-day Thailand ~2\u2009kya [2,5]. And, historical evidence indicates that the homeland of many ST and HM speaking hill tribe groups (e.g., Akha, Lisu, Lahu, Karen, Hmong, and IuMien) is in the area further north of Thailand, i.e., northern Myanmar, northern Laos, and southern China, and most of these groups migrated to present-day Thailand ~200\u2009ya [6,7]. Thus, the present-day cultural and linguistic variation in Thailand has multiple sources, but the HM and ST groups have not been studied in as much detail and the impact of this variation on genetic variation is still poorly understood.",
            "",
            "There are 14 populations sampled in the present study from northern Thailand (HM1\u2013HM5, Y1\u2013Y2, KSK3, MR, MR, LS and SH2) and northeastern Thailand (PT2 and IS5), together with 59 Thai/Lao populations sampled in previous studies [12\u201315]. Red stars, green triangles, black circles, and blue squares represent Hmong-Mien, Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, and Tai-Kadai speaking populations, respectively. The barplots on the left and right sides of the map depict the proportion of MSY and mtDNA haplogroups specific to Northeast Asia (NEA), Southeast Asia (SEA), or of unknown/other origin.",
            "The HM language family is one of the major language families in MSEA, comprising some 39 languages (35 Hmongic and 4 Mienic) distributed across China, northern Vietnam, northern Laos, and northern Thailand [8]. Although the Hmongic and Mienic languages are relatively similar to one another, there are differences due to divergent developments in the phonology [8]. The heartland of the Hmong people is considered to be in the present-day southern Chinese province of Kweichow, where they were established at least 2\u2009kya, probably arriving from the east [6]. Migrations into Thailand through Laos are documented since the second half of the 19th century A.D. The IuMien are, like the Hmong, thought to have an origin in southeastern China, from which they started to migrate southwards to Vietnam in the 13th century A.D., entering Thailand about 200\u2009ya [6,9]. With two main ST subfamilies, Chinese and Tibeto-Burman, the ST family is both large (~460 languages spoken by over a billion people) and spread across many countries in South, East and SEA, including China, Nepal, Bhutan, northeastern India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos [10].",
            "The HM and ST groups in Thailand are regarded as the hill tribes who inhabit the high mountainous northern and western region of Thailand. Consisting of ~700,000 people, there are nine officially recognized hill tribes: the AA-speaking Lawa, Htin and Khmu; the HM-speaking Hmong and IuMien; and the ST-speaking Karen, Lahu (or Mussur), Akha, and Lisu [6,7]. In addition to living in a remote and isolated region of Thailand, the hill tribes are of interest for their cultural variation. In particular, postmarital residence pattern varies among the hill tribes, with some practicing patrilocality (i.e., following marriage, the woman moves to the residence of the man) while others are matrilocal (i.e., the man moves to the residence of the woman). The first study to document an effect of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of human mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs. male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation was carried out on the hill tribes [11], and has been further investigated in subsequent studies [9,12].",
            "Our previous studies on the paternal and maternal genetic lineages and structure of many TK and AA groups indicated different and complex demographic histories in populations from Thailand and Laos [12\u201315]. However, the ST and HM speaking groups have not been studied in as much detail. Here we generated and analyzed 416 complete mtDNA genome sequences and 234 partial sequences of the MSY from 14 populations belonging to 11 HM and ST speaking hill tribe populations, and from three non-hill tribe TK populations: the Shan, who migrated recently from Myanmar and live in the mountainous area of northern Thailand; and the Phutai and Lao Isan from the Northeast of Thailand (Fig.1). This is the first detailed genetic study of Thai HM speaking groups and we also revisit the impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mtDNA and MSY variation with higher-resolution methods and more populations than studied previously.",
            "Samples were collected from 416 individuals belonging to 14 populations classified into three linguistic groups: (1) HM groups, consisting of five Hmong populations (HM1\u2013HM5) and two IuMien populations (Y1 and Y2); (2) ST groups, consisting of two Lahu populations (MR and MB), one Lisu (LS), and one Karen subgroup Skaw (KPW3); and (3) Tai-Kadai groups, consisting of one Shan population (SH2), one Phutai population (PT2), and one Lao Isan population (IS5); (Supplementary Table S1; Fig.1). Genomic DNA samples of HM1\u2013HM4 and Y1 and Y2 were from a previous study [16], while the remaining groups were newly-collected buccal samples obtained with written informed consent and with ethical approval from Khon Kaen University and the Ethics Commission of the University of Leipzig Medical Faculty. We extracted DNA using the Gentra Puregene Buccal Cell Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.",
            "Genomic libraries with double indices were prepared and enriched for mtDNA as described previously [17,18]. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 to obtain mtDNA consensus sequences as described in our previous studies [14,15]. We used Bustard for Illumina standard base calling and the read length was 76\u2009bp. We also enriched for \u223c2.3\u2009mB of the MSY from the same genomic libraries for male samples via in-solution hybridization-capture using a previously designed probe set [12,14] and the Agilent Sure Select system (Agilent, CA). The target MSY regions are positioned between positions 9927192 and 13199427 on the human reference genomehg19[12,14]. Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with paired-end reads of 125\u2009bp length and we used Bustard for Illumina standard base calling. The process for manipulating raw sequencing data, alignment and post-processing pipeline of the sequencing data for both mtDNA and MSY were carried out as previously described [12\u201315]. We then manually checked and manipulated sequences with Bioedit (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). The complete mtDNA sequence data set can be found at GenBank (accession numberMT418943\u2013MT419358). All reads that aligned to the region of the MSY that was targeted by the capture-enrichment array were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (study ID PRJEB36639). Final SNP genotypes and their chromosomal positions onhg19are provided in Supplementary Table S2.",
            "The newly-generated 234 MSY sequences from 14 populations were combined with 928 sequences from 59 populations from our previous studies [12,14] for a total of 1162 sequences belonging to 73 populations. For mtDNA, combining the 416 new sequences from this study with 1434 sequences from our previous studies [13\u201315] brings the total to 1850 sequences from 73 populations. Summary statistics of the genetic diversity within populations, the matrix of pairwise genetic distances (\u03a6st), and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were obtained with Arlequin 3.5.1.3 [19]. To visualize population relatedness, the R package [20] was used to carry out the nonmetric MDS analysis (based on the\u03a6stdistance matrices for the MSY and mtDNA) (R function: isoMDS package: MASS) and to construct heat plots of the\u03a6stdistance matrix and the matrix of shared haplotypes (R function: ape, pegas, adegenet and ggplot2 packages). STATISTICA 13.0 (StatSoft, Inc., USA) was used to carry out a correspondence analysis (CA) based on MSY and mtDNA haplogroup frequencies. For the MSY, haplogroup assignment was performed by yHaplo [21]. Haplogroups were assigned to the maximum depth possible given the phylogeny of ISOGG Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree 2015 (http://www.isogg.org/) and the available genetic markers in our target region. The derived SNPs for each sample are provided in Supplementary TableS2. The mtDNA haplogroups were assigned by Haplogrep2 [22] with PhyloTree mtDNA tree Build 17 (http://www.phylotree.org) [23] and the polymorphisms for each sample are provided in Supplementary TableS3. To obtain a broader picture of population relationships within SEA, we included publicly-available sequences from relevant populations for the MSY and mtDNA (Supplementary TableS4). To compare Northeast Asia (NEA) and SEA prevalent haplogroups with our studied populations, we calculated the frequency of MSY/mtDNA NEA and SEA prevalent haplogroups in the HM and ST speaking populations from China and Vietnam (Supplementary TableS5). To construct Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) per population and maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees per haplogroup, based on Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses, we used BEAST 1.8.4 [24]. For BSP plots by population, we conducted analyses both pooling all populations within the same ethnicity (e.g., pooling HM1-HM5), and for the individual populations. The Bayesian MCMC estimates (BE) and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals of haplogroup coalescent times were calculated using the CongPy6 sequence (haplogroup A1b1-M14) for rooting the tree for MSY haplogroup C [25] and the Mbuti-3 sequence (haplogroup B-M182) for rooting the tree for haplogroups F and O [26]. BEAST input files were created with BEAUTi v1.8.2 after first running jModel test 2.1.7 in order to choose the most suitable model of sequence evolution [27]. The best substitution models are shown in Supplementary TableS6. We used an MSY mutation rate of 8.71\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210substitutions/bp/year [28], and the BEAST input files were modified by an in-house script to add in the invariant sites found in our data set. Both strict and log normal relaxed clock models were run, with marginal likelihood estimation [29,30]. After each BEAST run, the Bayes factor was computed from the log marginal likelihood of both models to choose the best-fitting BSP/MCC tree (Supplementary TableS6). For mtDNA, we executed BSP analyses per population and the BEAST runs by haplogroup, with mutation rates of 1.708\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128and 9.883\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128for data partitioned between the coding and noncoding regions, respectively [31]. The RSRS was used for rooting the tree for mtDNA [32]. The strict clock model was used, and the best substitution models are shown in Supplementary TableS6. The Bayesian skyline piecewise linear tree prior for the dating and Bayesian skyline generation were applied, so as to allow for population size changes over time. The number of chains for each MCMC were varied based on sample sizes (Supplementary TableS6), but were always sufficient for successful Bayesian estimation and to reach ESS values above 200. Tracer 1.6 was used to generate the BSP plot from the BEAST results. The Bayesian MCC trees were assembled with TreeAnnotator and drawn with FigTree v 1.4.3.",
            "We combined the 234 newly-generated sequences with 928 sequences from our previous studies [12,14] for a total of 1161sequences, of which 818 are distinct, from 73 populations; population details are listed in Supplementary TableS1. The mean coverage of the newly-generated 234 MSY sequences of \u223c2.3\u2009mB ranges from 7\u00d7 to 60\u00d7 (overall average coverage 18\u00d7) (Supplementary TableS2).",

Haplogroup O2a2a1a2a1a2 (O-N5) and C-F845 are mostly prevalent in HM groups while haplogroup F is the dominant haplogroup of the Lahu (MR and MB). The coalescent ages of these three haplogroups are ~2.45\u2009kya (HPD: 2.88\u20131.13\u2009kya) for O2a2a1a2a1a2 (O-N5), ~12.54\u2009kya (HPD: 17.16\u20134.09\u2009kya) for C-F845 and ~16.00\u2009kya (HPD: 22.59\u201312.26\u2009kya) for haplogroup F. However, if we focus on HM or Lahu clades of the MCC tree of haplogroup C-F845, the age is ~2.85\u2009kya (HPD: 4.25\u20131.08\u2009kya) and ~0.58 ya (HPD: 1.55\u20130.29) for haplogroup F (Supplementary Fig.S2).",

In contrast O1b*, which is the predominant lineage in SEA and at high frequency in AA speaking people [12], is the major lineage in the Thai/Lao AA speaking group (except for some Mon populations who show evidence of admixture with Central Thai populations). Interestingly, there is heterogeneity in the frequency of NEA/SEA lineages in the Hmong and Lawa groups: among the five Hmong populations, HM5 completely lacks NEA lineages, while within the Lawa groups, LW2 has 56% NEA lineages while LW3 has exclusively SEA lineages (Fig.1).",

In contrast, the predominant SEA haplogroups (B5*, F1a*, M7b* and R9b*) are at highest frequency in TK and AA speaking groups, indicating genetic similarity between these two groups. Strikingly, the populations with the highest frequencies of NEA MSY lineages are not the same as the populations with the highest frequencies of NEA mtDNA lineages (Fig.1), which we suggest below may reflect differences in ancestral postmarital residence patterns.",
            "Overall, the HM, AA and ST groups tend to have more heterogeneous and lower genetic diversity values than the TK groups (Fig.2; Supplementary TableS9). By contrast, genetic diversities of the HM groups are not statistically different from the AA and ST groups, nor do the ST and AA groups differ significantly in genetic diversity values (Supplementary TableS9). At the individual population level, out of 63 populations, the Hmong (HM1) shows lower haplotype diversity than all other groups except for two hunter-gatherer groups (Mlabri (MA) and Maniq (MN)) and the Htin Mal (TN1). HM1 and HM5 have lower genetic diversity than the other HM populations, although HM2 shows the highest MPD values. Generally, the Hmong (HM1\u2013HM5) groups show lower haplotype and haplogroup diversity than the In Mien (Y1\u2013Y2) (Fig.2a, b). Of the eight ST speaking populations, the newly-studied Karen group (KSK3) exhibits lower genetic diversities while the Lisu (LS) and KSK1 have higher genetic diversities than the other ST speaking populations (Fig.2a\u2013d). Although low genetic diversities are observed in HM1, a significantly low Tajima\u2019sDvalue (Fig.2d) suggests recent paternal expansion in this group. Significant negative Tajima\u2019sDvalues were observed more frequently in the TK than in the AA and HM groups (P<\u20090.05: 11/34 for TK, 6/24 for AA, and 2/7 for HM) but no significant Tajima\u2019sDvalues were observed in any of the ST-speaking groups\u00a0(Fig.2d).",

In contrast to the MSY, the Hmong groups exhibited generally higher genetic diversities than the ST and AA speaking groups (Supplementary TableS9). Both the ST and AA groups have lower genetic diversity values than the TK groups (Supplementary TableS9). As also seen in the MSY results, both IuMien populations (Y1 and Y2) show higher genetic diversities than the other Hmong and ST speaking groups (Fig.2a\u2013c). In agreement with the MSY results, a significantly negative Tajima\u2019sDvalue was observed more frequently for the TK than for the AA and HM groups (P<\u20090.05: 21/34 for TK, 5/24 for AA, and 2/7 for HM).

            "The AMOVA results indicate that the variation among populations accounts for 13.72% of the total MSY genetic variance (Table1). The HM group shows the greatest genetic heterogeneity among populations, followed by the AA and ST groups; the TK group shows the lowest among-population variation. The Thai Hmong, with five populations sampled, shows higher variation among the populations than do the other hill tribe groups. When HM and ST populations from Vietnam [33] were included in the analysis, genetic variation among populations of the ST and HM groups increased substantially, suggesting some differentiation between Vietnamese and Thai populations belonging to these two groups. However, a direct comparison of Thai ST vs. Vietnamese ST, and Thai HM vs. Vietnamese HM groups, showed no significant differences between groups. The variation among populations within groups of the IuMien and Lahu were much lower than for the Hmong, indicating genetic heterogeneity of the Hmong and ST populations and more homogeneity for the IuMien and Lahu. The MSY genetic variation showed significant differences among the four language families (HM, ST, AA, and TK), but the variation among groups was lower than the variation among populations within each group, indicating that language families do not correspond to genetic structure. All pairwise comparisons of the four language families showed significant differences among groups, but these were on the same order as the differences among populations within the same group. However, when the HM were separated into Hmong and IuMien, the pairwise comparisons of Hmong with other language families remained significant, while for the IuMien there were no significant differences with other language families, suggesting some differences between Hmong and IuMien groups.

The Htin have by far the largest variation among populations, while the Hmong show nonsignificant mtDNA variation among populations (0.53%), reflecting genetic homogeneity in their maternal side. The mtDNA genetic variation among the four language families (HM, ST, AA, and TK) was much smaller (1.09%) than the variation among populations assigned to each group (7.7%), indicating that as with the MSY, language families do not correspond to the genetic structure of these populations. The variation between pairs of linguistic groups shows in all comparisons that the variation between groups is lower than the variation among populations within groups. As with the MSY, the lowest variation (which is not significantly different from zero) is between the TK and AA groups, further supporting a close relationship between these two groups in Thailand.",

In particular, the mtDNA variation among Hmong groups from Thailand and Vietnam was only 1.08%, which is not significantly different from zero.

The Lisu shared haplotypes with both Lahu (MB and MR) populations, while both Lahu populations shared haplotypes among themselves and also with one group of central Thai (CT5).

Based on the MDS results for both the MSY and mtDNA, we removed five highly-diverged populations (MA, MN, TN1, TN2, and SK); a three-dimension MDS for the remaining 68 populations has an acceptable stress value (Fig.4a\u2013c). There was overall some clustering of populations according to language family, albeit with some overlapping between them. The Hmong populations are quite distinct from all other groups, whereas the IuMien populations are more similar to other groups than to the Hmong groups.

As with the MSY results, the Lisu (LS) only shares haplotypes with both Lahu populations (MB and MR), indicating contact between them. The newly studied Karen population (KSK3) also exhibits large differences from the other Karen groups: there is no mtDNA haplotype sharing between the KSK3 and the other Karen populations, while some of the other Karen populations do share haplotypes with one another.",

After removal of the same five outliers as for the MSY analysis (MA, MN, TN1, TN2, and SK), the MDS analysis based on dimensions 1 and 2 shows separation between the Hmong populations and the ST populations, with the IuMien populations rather closer to the cloud of TK populations around the center of the plot.

If genetic variation was influenced by residence pattern, then lower within-population genetic diversity coupled with greater genetic heterogeneity among populations is expected for matrilocal groups than for patrilocal groups for the mtDNA, whereas the opposite pattern is expected for the MSY [11]. However, the MSYhand MPD values do not differ significantly between patrilocal and matrilocal groups (Supplementary TableS9and Fig. S9). For mtDNA, genetic diversity values are significantly higher for patrilocal than for matrilocal groups forhbut the differences are not statistically significant for MPD (Supplementary TableS9). Notably, the patrilocal groups HM1, HM4, and LS exhibit higher than average MPD values for the MSY (78.65\u201399.37, compared with the average of 51.74) and some matrilocal groups, e.g., KSK3 and TN1-TN2, show much lower MPD (6.92\u201320.69) than average (33.99) for mtDNA (Supplementary TableS9). Furthermore, the genetic diversity of all Htin groups are much lower than the other groups (Supplementary Fig.S9).",
            "For genetic differences between populations revealed by AMOVA (Table1), the MSY genetic variation among patrilocal populations is much higher than that for mtDNA (MSY: 27.43%,P<\u20090.01; mtDNA: 6.36%,P<\u20090.01), while for the matrilocal groups the mtDNA genetic variation is much higher, but still less than that for the MSY (MSY: 24.49%,P<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 16.46%,P<\u20090.01). Much stronger contrasting between-group variation is seen in two patrilocal groups, i.e., Hmong (MSY: 18.13%,P<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 0.53%,P>\u20090.05) and Lawa (MSY: 35.65%,P<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 7.78%,P<\u20090.01) and one matrilocal Htin group (MSY: 9.85%,P<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 25.71%,P<\u20090.01) (Supplementary Fig.S10). In contrast to our previous study [12], with the inclusion of the new KSK3 population, the matrilocal Karen shows more differentiation for the MSY than for mtDNA (MSY: 9.11%,P<\u20090.01, mtDNA: 5.85%,P<\u20090.01). When Hmong, IuMien, and Lahu from Thailand and Vietnam were combined, contrasting patterns of genetic variation between the MSY and mtDNA were still in accordance with expectations based on residence pattern, albeit the IuMien show only slightly higher between-group differentiation for the MSY than for mtDNA (Table1).",
            "Another potential effect of patrilocality vs. matrilocality is on the shared haplotypes between populations. If recent contact between populations is influenced by residence pattern, one would expect more MSY haplotype sharing among matrilocal groups than among patrilocal groups, and more mtDNA sharing among patrilocal groups than among matrilocal groups. However, the results for haplotype sharing between populations within matrilocal and patrilocal groups do not show a strong effect (Supplementary TableS10). Haplotype sharing for the MSY is slightly lower on average for patrilocal groups (0.15) than for matrilocal groups (0.18), in accordance with expectations, but haplotype sharing for mtDNA is also lower on average for patrilocal groups (0.15) than for matrilocal groups (0.22), which is not in accordance with expectations based on residence pattern.",
            "Our previous studies have focused on the genetic ancestry of the TK and AA groups in Thailand and Laos, here we investigate the less well-studied HM and ST speaking groups from Thailand, to gain more insights into the genetic history of MSEA. We sequenced \u223c2.3\u2009mB of the MSY and complete mtDNA genomes of the HM and ST groups who are regarded as hill tribes from northern Thailand, as well as additional TK groups from northern and northeastern Thailand. Although we focus on the HM and ST groups, we note that the previously-observed general pattern of overall genetic homogeneity of Thailand TK groups [12] continues to be maintained with these additional TK groups, consistent with the idea that the TK language family spread via demic diffusion [13]. However, an additional insight arises when we compare the Thai TK data to similar mtDNA and MSY data from Vietnamese TK groups: [33] some of the TK-speaking groups from Vietnam (i.e., Nung, Tay, and Thai) are quite similar to the TK populations from northeastern Thailand (Phutai, Kalueang, and Black Tai) (Fig.5). This is in agreement with historical evidence for a migration of the ancestors of the Phutai, Kalueang, and Black Tai from Vietnam through Laos during last 200 years [6,34].",
            "Previous studies of HM groups have reported sequences of the mtDNA hypervariable region 1 with some diagnostic coding SNPs to define haplogroups [35], and Y-STR variation and genotypes for Y chromosomal bi-allelic loci [36]. Here we analyze complete mtDNA and partial MSY sequences from five Hmong and two IuMien populations from Thailand; strikingly, we find significant differences between Hmong and Mien populations in Thailand, with the IuMien more similar to other populations (Figs.3,4,\u00a0Supplementary Fig.S6,S7, Table1), while the Hmong show genetic distinction that was not previously documented in Thai/Lao populations (Figs.3,4, Supplementary Figs.S6,S7and Table1).",
            "Apart from the genetic distinction from their linguistic relatives, the IuMien, the Hmong in Thailand are genetically distinct from almost all other groups (Fig.3). There are no shared mtDNA haplotypes between HM populations and other Thai/Lao populations, and only a few shared MSY haplotypes (Fig.3a), moreover, they do not overlap with other groups in the MDS analysis (Fig.4), suggesting that they add unique genetic profiles that were not found in the previous studies of Thai/Lao AA, TK, and ST groups [12]. This striking genetic divergence of Hmong populations in Thailand may reflect cultural isolation. Hmong communities have strong connections and prefer to marry with other Hmong groups rather than with non-Hmong groups [6]. In contrast, the IuMien have shared haplotypes and closer genetic relatedness with several TK-speaking groups, indicating more contact with other groups. These results may reflect the pronounced IuMien culture for adoption. Based on ethnographic accounts from the 1960s, around 10\u201320% of adult IuMien were adopted from other ethnic groups (both highland and lowland), in order to increase the size of their household and their family\u2019s influence [6,9,37]. Another factor behind the genetic similarity of IuMien with other East Asian populations could be admixture, as suggested by sharing of features between IuMien (but not Hmong) and Sinitic languages [38].",
            "Although the proto-HM groups were suggested to have originated in central and southern China during the Neolithic Period [35], their greatest ethnolinguistic diversity is found between the Yangtze and Mekong rivers today. In general, the ages of mtDNA and MSY haplogroups characteristic for HM groups are during the Holocene to the late Neolithic Period (Supplementary Figs.S2,S3). This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence that the proto-HM group might be linked with the Neolithic cultures in the Middle Reach of the Yangtze River in southern China, namely the Daxi culture (5300\u20136400 kya) and the Qujialing culture (4600\u20135000 kya) [35]. Our results are also consistent with a recent study of HM groups from H\u00fan\u00e1n, China [39], which identified lineages within MSY haplogroup O-N5 as specific to Hmong (and dated to \u223c2.33\u2009kya) and mtDNA haplogroup B5a1c1a as correlating with Pahng and IuMien (and dated to \u223c9.80\u2009kya). However, we do find B5a1c1a* and B5a1c1a1 specific to Hmong, but not IuMien, in Thailand. Overall, the coalescent ages of both MSY and mtDNA lineages are in the same range.",
            "It has been proposed that Neolithic people living at least 6\u2009kya [40] in northwestern China were probably the ancestors of modern ST populations. It has also been suggested that ST languages originated among millet farmers, located in North China, around 7.2\u2009kya [41] or 5.9\u2009kya [42]. Linguistic evidence then suggests differentiation between Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman languages, and also between Tibetan and Lolo-Burmese languages, and southward and westward expansions of ST groups [41,42].",
            "Although an MSY lineage (O-M122*) was proposed to be characteristic of all modern ST populations [43], subsequent studies have found further differentiation, e.g., haplogroup O2a1c-002611, which is at high frequency in Han Chinese but found at very low frequencies in Tibeto-Burman populations [44,45]. Also, autosomal STR genotypes differentiate Tibetan and Lolo-Burmese speaking groups [46].",
            "ST-speaking groups in Thailand have not been studied in the same detail as those in China; here we analyzed three groups: Lisu, Lahu (Mussur), and Karen. Lisu and Lahu speak Lolo-Burmese languages, while the Karen languages belong to a different branch, Karenic [6]. Historical evidence indicates that Lisu and Lahu migrated from southern China through Myanmar to northern Thailand about 100\u2013200 years ago [6]. The Karen claim to be the first settlers in Myanmar who migrated from southern China before the arrival of Mon and Burmese people, and the Karen groups in Thailand have been migrating from Myanmar started around 1750 A.D. due to the growing influence of the Burmese [47].",
            "The genetic distances between the Lisu and Lahu are significantly different from zero for both mtDNA and the MSY, and they also share both mtDNA and MSY haplotypes (Fig.3a, b), indicating recent contact and/or shared ancestry. The two Lahu populations (Black Lahu (MB) and Red Lahu (MR)) are genetically similar to one another and both are genetically distinct from the other populations (Figs.3b,4b\u2013d). However, the Lisu do not differ significantly from many AA and TK populations (Fig.3b), suggesting interactions between the Lisu and other populations. For the Karen, we have added an additional Karen population (Skaw (KSK3)) to the previously studied Karen populations; KSK3 has very low haplogroup diversity and MPD values for the MSY (Fig.2), suggesting strong genetic drift that has in turn increased their divergence from the other Karen populations (Fig.4). This is in keeping with historical information: according to their oral history, KSK3 was founded ~60 years ago by just 18 households in a very remote region that is isolated from other Karen villages. The other Karen groups are genetically similar to several populations, and also share many basal mtDNA M haplogroups (M21a, M* and M91a) with neighboring Austroasiatic populations, especially the Mon, suggesting significant admixing (Supplementary TableS8). Previous studies based on autosomal STRs and SNPs also support the relatedness of the Karen and other AA groups in Thailand [47,48].",
            "The estimated coalescent ages of the predominant lineages in ST populations provide an upper bound for their divergence/contact from other groups. MSY haplogroup O2a2b1a1-Page23, equivalent to O-M117, which was previously reported to be abundant in TB groups in southwestern China and in Han Chinese [45], was dated to around ~2.41\u2009kya in this study. However, this MSY lineage also occurs in HM, TK, and AA populations, reflecting recent shared ancestry and/or contact (Supplementary Fig.S2). The ages of mtDNA haplogroups prevalent in Lahu and Lisu, namely A13, B4e, D4j1a1, and G1c, are dated to ~6.74, ~2.21, ~2.49, and ~2.20\u2009kya, respectively (Supplementary Fig.S3). Thus, the coalescent ages of many MSY and mtDNA lineages prevalent in ST groups are around the time of the Han expansion (~2.5\u2009kya) [49].",
            "Previously, postmarital residence pattern has been shown to influence genetic variation in the hill tribes of Thailand [9,11,12]. Our previous study had investigated four hill tribes: Lawa, Htin, Khmu and Karen [12]. Here we added data from four additional hill tribes (Hmong, IuMien, Lahu, and Lisu) for the most detailed investigation to date, comprising a total of 23 populations belonging to eight hill tribes. The Hmong, IuMien, Lisu, Lawa and Khmu are patrilocal (i.e., the wife moves to the residence of the husband after marriage) whereas the others are matrilocal. If postmarital residence pattern is having an influence on patterns of genetic variation, we would expect larger between-group differences and smaller within-group diversity for patrilocal groups for the MSY, and the same trends for matrilocal groups for mtDNA [11].",
            "In general, the within-population genetic diversity values were not in agreement with expectations (Supplementary TableS9and Fig. S10) whereas genetic differentiation between populations did go in the direction predicted by postmarital residence pattern (Table1). However, when focusing on genetic differentiation within individual groups, the patrilocal Hmong and Lawa and the matrilocal Htin did fit with expectations, i.e., higher genetic differentiation among populations for the MSY than for mtDNA for the Hmong and Lawa, and the opposite for the Htin (Table1). However, the matrilocal Karen show higher differentiation for the MSY than for mtDNA (Table1), contrary to expectations and contrary to previous results based on four Karen populations [12]. The addition of the KSK3 population increases the between-population MSY genetic variance from 2.3 to 9.1%, while the between-population mtDNA genetic variance is relatively unchanged. The low MSY MPD value (Fig.2c) and outlier position in the MSY MDS plots (Fig.4), as well as their oral history, indicate a strong effect of genetic drift on MSY variation in KSK3, which might then mitigate any influence of postmarital residence pattern on MSY vs. mtDNA variation. Interestingly, overall we find less contrast between matrilocal and patrilocal groups than found previously for the hill tribes [9,11,12]. Presumably this is because of both more detailed sampling and higher-resolution analysis of the mtDNA and MSY genomes. And, this is not unexpected because while some studies find an impact of residence pattern on mtDNA/MSY variation, others do not [50,51]. Many different factors can influence mtDNA/MSY variation, e.g., micro-evolutionarily factors such as genetic drift (as seen with the TN1, LW2 and KSK3 population), physical landscape, and other human cultural patterns, e.g., adoption in IuMien and cultural isolation and intermarriage in Hmong and Lawa [9,12,52,53]; these can dilute or erase any potential impact of residence pattern.",
            "Nonetheless, one striking pattern remains in our data, and that concerns NEA vs. SEA ancestry. Previous genetic studies supported a north-south division in East Asian peoples and with some spread of northern ancestry to the south [35,49]. There are distinct differences in the mtDNA and MSY lineages of NEA vs. SEA populations [48,49,54], and here we also find a higher frequency of both mtDNA and MSY lineages of SEA origin than of NEA origin in most of the studied populations. In general, the SEA specific maternal lineages (B5*, F1a*, M7b* and R9b*) are at an average frequency of 38.28%, while NEA mtDNA lineages (i.e., A*, D* and G*) have an average frequency of 9.38% (Supplementary TableS8). The MSY haplogroups also show major SEA lineages (O1b*) predominating at an average frequency of 45.35%, and minor NEA lineages (C2e*, D-M174 and N*) at an average frequency of 8.33% (Supplementary TableS7).",
            "However, the HM and ST groups are a dramatic exception to this general pattern of higher SEA than NEA ancestry for both paternal and maternal lineages (Fig.1). The estimated NEA maternal ancestry of the HM groups is 11.94%, comparable to that of other Thai/Lao populations (average\u2009=\u20099.11%), while the average frequency of NEA paternal lineages in HM groups is 24.72% (compared with the average frequency of 6.59% for other Thai/Lao populations). Conversely, in the ST groups we detect an average of 24.09% NEA maternal ancestry, which is much higher than the average NEA maternal ancestry for other Thai/Lao groups (7.57%), while the NEA paternal ancestry in ST groups is comparable to that in other Thai/Lao groups (11.95% vs. 7.88%).",
            "Given that both HM and ST groups originated from southern China or northwestern China, it is likely that the ancestral HM and ST groups both had relatively high levels of NEA ancestry for both the MSY and mtDNA, as this has been reported for contemporary Chinese populations (Supplementary TableS5) [35,39,54,55]. We suggest that there was subsequent contact with SEA groups as their ancestors migrated southward, with HM populations incorporating more SEA maternal than paternal lineages, and ST populations incorporating more SEA paternal than maternal lineages. This could be explained if the ancestral HM group was patrilocal (as all HM populations are today), and so subsequent interactions between the HM ancestors and SEA groups incorporated more SEA mtDNA lineages than MSY lineages into HM populations. Conversely, if the ancestral ST group was matrilocal (as the Karen and Lahu are today), subsequent interactions between ST ancestors and SEA groups would have incorporated more SEA MSY lineages than mtDNA lineages into ST populations. Matrilocality for ancient ST groups has also been suggested based on linguistic evidence [56]. The fact that some ST populations are now patrilocal (e.g., Lisu) while still exhibiting higher frequencies of NEA maternal lineages may then reflect recent changes from matrilocality to patrilocality.",
            "However, the interaction between NEA and SEA groups was undoubtedly a complex admixture process that started in prehistoric times and has continued into historic times, and there are many factors in addition to residence pattern that could have led to sex-biased admixture [55]. Additional studies of both other ethnolinguistic groups (e.g., Akha, who show strong cultural practice preservation) as well as populations sampled from different villages of Lahu, Lisu, and IuMien from northern Thailand and Hmong and Karen (Skaw and Kayah) from western and central Thailand, are necessary to further investigate this pattern.",
            "We have carried out the most extensive study to date, using high-resolution methods, of the maternal and paternal lineages in HM and ST speaking groups of northern Thailand. We find unexpected differences between the Hmong and IuMien, which may reflect different cultural practices, and genetic heterogeneity among ST groups. Compared with previous studies, we find less contrast in genetic diversity and differentiation between matrilocal and patrilocal groups among the hill tribes. However, a novel finding of this study is the contrast between HM and ST groups, both assumed to have origins in southern China, in frequencies of NEA maternal and paternal lineages. We suggest that this striking difference reflects ancestral patrilocality for HM groups vs. ancestral matrilocality for ST groups. Overall, our results further attest to the impact of cultural practices on patterns of mtDNA vs. MSY variation in human populations.",

            "Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99% of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99% accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119\u2009million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90\u2009million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34% and increased the number of structural variants detected\u00a0per haplotype by 104% compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.",

            "Although T2T-CHM13 represents a major achievement, no single genome can represent the genetic diversity of our species. Previous studies have identified tens of megabases of sequence contained within structural variants (SVs) that are polymorphic within the population5. Owing to the absence of these alternative alleles from the reference genome, more than two-thirds of SVs have been missed in studies that used short-read data and the human reference assembly6\u20138, despite individual SVs being more likely to affect gene function than either individual SNPs or short insertions and deletions (indels)9,10.",
            "To overcome reference bias, a transition to a pangenomic reference has been envisioned11,12. Pangenomic methods have rapidly progressed over the past few years13\u201315such that it is now practical to propose that common genomic analyses use a pangenome. Here we sequence and assemble a set of diverse individual genomes and present a draft human pangenome, the first release from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC)15. These genomes represent a subset of the planned HPRC panel, which aims to better capture global genomic diversity across the 700 haplotypes of 350 individuals.",
            "We assembled 47 fully phased diploid assemblies from genomes selected to represent global genetic diversity (Fig.1a) and for which consent had been given for unrestricted access. All assemblies have been made publicly available, along with all data and analyses. These assemblies include 29 samples with long and linked read sequencing data generated entirely by the HPRC and 18 samples sequenced by other efforts16\u201318. In some cases, we supplemented the 18 additional samples with further sequencing. We selected the 29 HPRC samples from the 1KG lymphoblastoid cell lines, limiting selection to those lines classified as karyotypically normal and with low passage (to avoid artefacts from cell culture). We also ensured that the cell lines were derived from participants for whom whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data were available for both parents (for haplotype phasing). Cell lines meeting these criteria were prioritized by genetic and biogeographic diversity (Methods).",

The data included Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) high-fidelity (HiFi) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing, Bionano optical maps and high-coverage Hi-C Illumina short-read sequencing for all HPRC samples. We also gathered previously generated high-coverage Illumina sequencing data for both parents of each participant19. We generated on average 39.7\u00d7 HiFi sequence depth of coverage for the 46 HPRC samples (excluding HG002, which had around 130\u00d7 coverage). This depth of coverage is consistent with the requirements for high-quality, state-of-the-art assemblies20and facilitates comprehensive variant discovery irrespective of allele frequency (AF). The N50 value, which represents the shortest read length at which 50% of the total sequenced bases are covered by considering only equal or longer reads, was 19.6\u2009kb\u00a0on average for the HiFi reads (Supplementary Table1; excluding HG002 because it was sequenced using a different library preparation protocol).",

Trio-Hifiasm uses PacBio HiFi long-read sequences and parental Illumina short-read sequences to produce near fully phased contig assemblies. The complete assembly pipeline (Supplementary Fig.1andMethods) included steps to remove adaptor and nonhuman sequence contamination and to ensure a single mitochondrial assembly per maternal assembly.",
            "We first searched for large-scale misassemblies, looking for gene duplication errors, phasing errors and interchromosomal misjoins (Methods). We manually fixed three large duplication errors and one large phasing error, but left smaller errors, which are difficult to definitively distinguish from SVs. We found 217 putative interchromosomal joins. Only one of these joins (in the paternal assembly of HG02080) was located in a euchromatic, non-acrocentric region and was manually confirmed to be a misassembly. The remaining joins involved the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes (Fig.1band Supplementary Table2). This may be the result of misalignment, nonallelic gene conversion or other biological mechanisms that maintain large-scale homology between the short arms of the acrocentrics\u2014a phenomenon that we have studied in an associated paper22.",
            "To evaluate the resulting assemblies after manual correction of errors, we developed an automated assembly quality control pipeline that combined methods to assess the completeness, contiguity, base level quality and phasing accuracy of each assembly (Supplementary Table3andMethods). Haploid assemblies containing an X\u2009chromosome averaged a total length of 3.04\u2009Gb, 99.3% the length of T2T-CHM13 (3.06\u2009Gb), which also contains an X\u2009chromosome. Haploid assemblies containing a Y\u2009chromosome averaged a total length of 2.93\u2009Gb, which reflects the size difference between the sex chromosomes (Fig.1c). The average NG50 value, a widely used measure of contiguity, was comparable with the contig NG50 of GRCh38 (40\u2009Mb compared with 56\u2009Mb, respectively; Fig.1d). Using short substrings (k-mer values of 31) derived from Illumina data, the Yakk-mer analyser20estimated an average quality value (QV) of 53.57 for the assemblies, which corresponded to an average of 1 base error per 227,509 bases (Fig.1e). To validate these QV estimates, we benchmarked the HG002 and HG005 assembly-based variant calls against the small variants called using Genome in a Bottle (GIAB; v.4.2.1). We estimated QVs of 54 for HG002 and 55 for HG005, which were highly similar to thek-mer QVs estimated using Yak. Consistent with our manual observation that most errors were primarily small indels in low-complexity regions, we found that approximately 32% of the indel errors were in homopolymers longer than 5\u2009bp and an additional 48% were in tandem repeats and low-complexity regions. Moreover, about 42% of the indel errors were genotype errors, mostly heterozygous variants incorrectly called as homozygous variants due to collapsed haplotypes in the two assemblies of an individual (Supplementary Table4). We next used Yak to analyse the phasing accuracy between the maternal and paternal assemblies usingk-mer values derived from Illumina sequencing of the parents. An average haplotype switch error rate of 0.67% was observed and a Hamming error rate of 0.79% (Fig.1f). We also calculated phase accuracy using Pstools23,24, which uses Hi-C sequence data of the sample not used to create the assembly. Pstools reported slightly lower switch error rates than Yak but comparable Hamming error rates (Supplementary Fig.2). Taken together, the above results indicate that the assemblies are highly contiguous and accurate.",
            "To determine which portions of the assemblies are reliable, we developed a read-based pipeline, Flagger, that detects different types of misassemblies within a phased diploid assembly (Fig.1gandMethods). The pipeline works by mapping the HiFi reads to the combined maternal and paternal assembly in a haplotype-aware manner. It then identifies coverage inconsistencies within these read mappings that are likely to be due to assembly errors. This process is similar to likelihood-based approaches, which assess the assembly given the reads25, but is adapted to work with long reads and diploid assemblies. Using Flagger, we identified only 0.88% (26.4\u2009Mb) of each assembly as unreliable (Fig.1hand Supplementary Table5). Using T2T-CHM13, we estimated that 0.09% of reliably assembled blocks were falsely labelled as unreliable (Methods). Compared with the distribution of contig sizes, the unreliable blocks were short (54.6\u2009kb N50 average). We intersected the unreliable blocks in the assemblies from Flagger with different repeat annotations (Fig.1iand Supplementary Table6). We estimated that the following percentage of elements were correctly assembled: 95.4% of alpha satellites; 91.5% of human satellites\u20092 and 3; 97.7% of segmental duplications (SDs); 94.3% of variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs); 94.2% of short tandem repeats (STRs); and 98.8% of all human repeats26.",
            "To assess the completeness and copy number polymorphism of the assemblies, we aligned them to T2T-CHM13 (Methods). The paternal assemblies of male samples covered about 92.8% of T2T-CHM13 (excluding chromosome\u2009X) on average with exactly one alignment. For all other assemblies (excluding chromosome\u2009Y), about 94.1% on average was single-copy covered (Fig.1jand Supplementary Table7). On average, around 136\u2009Mb (4.4%) of T2T-CHM13 was not covered by any alignment, which indicates that some parts of the genome are either systematically unassembled or cannot be reliably aligned. About 90% of these regions were centromeric or pericentromeric27(Extended Data Fig.1). Despite the majority of unaligned bases occurring within and around centromeres, on average, 90% of divergent and monomeric alpha satellites, gamma satellites and centromeric transition regions were covered by at least one alignment. Excluding the T2T-CHM13 centromere and satellites3and including only the expected sex chromosome for each haploid assembly, on average, around 99.12% of the remaining reference was covered by exactly one alignment (Supplementary Table7).",

We characterized these regions using the peri/centromeric annotation available for the T2T-CHM13\u00a0(v.2.0) reference. We made separate bar plots for male and female samples to exclude chromosome X for the paternal assemblies of male samples and exclude chromosome Y for all other assemblies. Panelsaandbindicate that on average ~90% of the uncovered bases are located in peri/centromeric regions with the active/inactive alpha satellites and human satellite 3 comprising ~50% of these bases, mainly due to their highly repetitive composition and also higher frequency compared to other satellites.

            "The average number of T2T-CHM13 bases with two or with more than two alignments was about 32.4\u2009Mb (around 1.0%) and about 20.0\u2009Mb (around 0.6%), respectively. On average, per haploid assembly, these duplicated regions had about 82.20% and 39.82% overlap with the pericentomeric or centromeric satellites and SDs, respectively, and around 94.62% had overlap with either of them. We characterized the accuracy of regions aligned to SDs in T2T-CHM13 (excluding chromosome\u2009Y) using a liftover of the assembly read-depth-based evaluation (Extended Data Fig.2). On average, we estimated that only 2.5% (4.99 out of 199\u2009Mb) of the SD sequence that could be lifted onto T2T-CHM13 was in error according to the read depth. To identify SDs associated with these errors, we took all 5\u2009kb windows across the unreliable regions and intersected them with the longest and most identical overlapping SD. The median length of SDs overlapping sequences in error was 3.0 times longer (288\u2009kb compared with 96.3\u2009kb) than those in correctly assembled SDs and 1.8% more identical (98.9 compared with 97.1).

Similarly, a median of 98.16% of noncoding genes (range\u2009=\u200997.23\u201398.60%) and 98.96% of noncoding transcripts (range\u2009=\u200997.94\u201399.28%) were similarly annotated. Running this pipeline on T2T-CHM13 produced similar, slightly higher, results. Intersecting the HPRC annotations with the assembly reliability predictions, a median of 99.53% of gene and 99.79% of transcript annotations occurred wholly within reliable regions, which indicated that most of the annotated transcript haplotypes were structurally correct. To examine transcriptome base accuracy, we looked for nonsense and frameshift mutations in the set of canonical transcripts (one representative transcript per gene; Supplementary Fig.3, Supplementary Table8andMethods). We found a median of 25 nonsense mutations and 72 frameshifts per assembly. A median of 21 (84%) and 58 (80%) of these nonsense mutations and frameshifts per assembly, respectively, were supported by the independently generated Illumina variant call sets. These numbers were within the range of previously reported numbers of loss-of-function mutations (between 10 and 150 per person, depending on the level of conservation of the mutation)1,30. Conservatively, if all the non-confirmed frameshifts and nonsense mutations are assembly errors, this would predict 18 such transcript-altering errors per transcriptome (1\u2009per 1.7\u2009million assembled transcriptome bases).",

            "There were 1,115 protein-coding gene families within the Flagger-predicted reliable regions of the full set of assemblies that had a gain in copy number in at least one genome (Fig.2b). Each assembly had an average of 36 genes with a gain in copy number relative to GRCh38 within its predicted reliable regions, with a bias towards rare, low-copy CNVs (Fig.2c). In detail, 71% of CNV genes appeared in a single haplotype. Previous studies using read depth found that rare CNVs generally occur outside regions annotated as being enriched in SDs31. The genome assemblies confirmed this observation in sequence-resolved CNVs. When stratifying duplicated genes on the basis of AF into singleton (present in one haplotype), low frequency (<10%) and high frequency, 15% (118 out of 771) of the singleton CNVs mapped to SDs as annotated in GRCh38. Duplicated genes with a higher population frequency had a greater fraction in SDs: 59% (83 out of 140) of low frequency and 81% (44 out of 54) of high frequency. Overall, 58 genes were CNVs in 10% or more of haploid assemblies, and 16 genes were amplified in the majority of individuals relative to GRCh38 (Fig.2dand Supplementary Table9). Many of these genes were individually highly copy-number polymorphic and part of complex tandem duplications (Fig.2e). For example,GPRIN2is a copy-number polymorphic32based on read depth and has a sequence resolution of one to three additional copies duplicated in tandem in the pangenome (Fig.2f).SPDYE2is similarly resolved as one to four additional copies duplicated in tandem (Fig.2g). Other CNV genes were not contiguously resolved and reflect limitations of the current assemblies (see the associated article33).

            "The process of generating a combined pangenome representation is an active research area. The problem is nontrivial both because of computational challenges (there are hundreds of billions of bases of sequence to align) and because determining which alignments to include is not always obvious, particularly for recently duplicated and repetitive sequences. We applied three different graph construction methods that have been under active development for this project: Minigraph34, Minigraph-Cactus (MC)35and PanGenome Graph Builder (PGGB)36(Extended Data Fig.3andMethods). The availability of these three models provided us with multiple views into homology relationships in the pangenome while supporting validation of discovered variation by independent methods. We included GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 references within the pangenomes, and three samples (HG002, HG005 and NA19240) were held out to permit their use in benchmarking (hence 90 haplotypes total). In brief, Minigraph builds a pangenome by starting from a reference assembly, here GRCh38, and iteratively and progressively adds in additional assemblies, recording only SVs\u2009\u2265\u200950 bases. It admits complex variants, including duplications and inversions. MC extends the Minigraph pangenome with a base level alignment of the homology relationships between the assemblies using the Cactus genome aligner37while retaining the structure of the Minigraph pangenome. PGGB constructs a pangenome from an all-to-all alignment of the assemblies.

MC added small variants (<50 bp) to the pangenome graph constructed by Minigraph. PGGB used a symmetric, all-by-all alignment of haplotypes to build a pangenome graph whose structure is not affected by the order of inputs (unlike Minigraph and MC). The critical difference in graph construction is that, due to ambiguous pairwise relationships of paralogs, PGGB tends to collapse copy-number polymorphic loci like segmental duplications and VNTRs into a single copy through which haplotypes loop, while Minigraph and MC do not.",
            "The different algorithmic approaches used to construct a pangenome graph influence graph properties while representing the same underlying sequences. The basic properties of the three graphs produced with the different pangenome methods are shown in Supplementary Table10. The Minigraph chart, by virtue of being limited to structural variation, is the smallest, with more than two orders of magnitude fewer nodes and edges than the base level graphs. Its length (3.24\u2009Gb), measured as the total bases of all nodes, is similar to the MC graph (3.29\u2009Gb) despite the latter adding many small variants. This difference is due to the MC graph also aligning a significant number of sequences left unaligned by Minigraph. The PGGB graph contains roughly 5\u2009Gb more sequence because it includes highly structurally divergent satellite regions omitted from the other approaches (Methods) and does not implement any trimming or filtering of the input assembly contigs.",
            "To characterize variants in the pangenome graphs, we used graph decomposition to identify \u2018bubble\u2019 subgraphs that correspond to non-overlapping variant sites. We then classified variant sites into small variants (<50\u2009bp) and SVs (\u226550\u2009bp) of different types (Methods). We found similar numbers of each variant type in each pangenome, with 22\u2009million small variants in the MC graph (21\u2009million in PGGB) (Fig.3b), and 67,000 SVs in the MC graph (73,000 in PGGB, 75,000 in Minigraph) (Fig.3c). We assessed variation in each individual assembly by tracing their paths through the graphs and found similar numbers of small variants and SVs within confident genomic regions defined by Dipcall38. Specifically, there were 5.34\u2009million small variants per sample and 16,800 SVs per haplotype on average in the MC graph (5.35\u2009million and 17,400, respectively in PGGB) (Fig.3e,f). Differences in variant counts among samples from different ancestry groups recapitulated previous observations1. There was a total of 90\u2009Mb of non-reference sequence in the SV sites, excluding difficult-to-align centromeric repeats, in the MC graph (55\u2009Mb for PGGB, 86\u2009Mb for Minigraph). Alu, L1 and ERV SVs appeared largely biallelic, whereas VNTRs frequently had three or more distinct alleles per site. The minor AF in the pangenomes of biallelic variants was similar for SNPs and for L1, Alu and VNTR variants, although VNTRs showed a slight shift towards more common alleles (Fig.3d).",
            "We quantified the amount of euchromatic autosomal non-reference (GRCh38) sequence that each of the 44 diploid genomes incrementally contributes to the pangenome (Fig.3gandMethods) for both MC and PGGB graphs. We limited the analysis to the euchromatic sequence because we were generally confident in its assembly and alignment, and much of the heterochromatic sequence was omitted from the MC graph (Methods). Overall, the euchromatic autosomal non-reference sequence added up to about 175\u2009Mb in the MC graph (around 190\u2009Mb in PGGB), out of which about 55\u2009Mb (around 105\u2009Mb in PGGB) was observed only on a single haplotype. Our analysis further suggested that about 5\u2009Mb and 70\u2009Mb in the MC graph (around 10\u2009Mb and 60\u2009Mb in PCGB) could be attributed to core (present in \u226595% of all haplotypes) and common genomes (present in \u22655% of all haplotypes), respectively (Supplementary Table11). We also estimated the growth of the euchromatic autosomal pangenome independent of the order of genomes by sampling 200 permutations (Supplementary Fig.4) and recording the median pangenome size across all samples in the MC graph. Our results indicated that the second genome added around 23\u2009Mb of euchromatic autosomal sequence to the pangenome, whereas the last genome tended to add only about 0.64\u2009Mb. These numbers are conservative owing to additional highly polymorphic sequence residing in assembly gaps. Extrapolating under Heaps\u2019 Law39(Methods), we anticipate that at least an additional 150\u2009Mb of euchromatic autosomal sequence will be added in the pangenome graph when HPRC produces 700 haplotypes in the future.",

In the MC graph, about 60.2% (around 9.7\u2009million variants) had an AF of 1% or greater. About 35.7% were rare, having an AF less than 1% but above zero. About 1.7% were singleton. The remaining 2.4% were missing from gnomAD. Similar results were obtained using the PGGB graph by repeating this exercise with small variant calls detected by pairwise alignment of assemblies to GRCh38 using Dipcall38and by calling small variants from the HiFi sequencing data using DeepVariant40. Given that 1KG samples are included in gnomAD, these missing variants are expected to be a mixture of false negatives in gnomAD and false positives in the pangenome.",
            "To further explore the quality of variant calls captured by assembly and graph construction, we compared pangenome-decoded variants against GRCh38 to variant sets identified by conventional reference-based genotyping methods (Supplementary Fig.5andMethods). These reference-based call sets were generated from the PacBio HiFi reads and haplotype-resolved assemblies using the following different discovery methods: DeepVariant40, PBSV41, Sniffles42with Iris43, SVIM44, SVIM-asm45, PAV5and the Hall-lab pipeline (Methods). For benchmarking small variants, we excluded regions that contained SVs detected or implied by the alignment of the haploid assemblies of that sample to GRCh38, as current benchmarking tools do not account for different representations of small variants inside or near SVs (Methods). Comparing small variants (Fig.4a) and SVs (Fig.4b) from the pangenomes to the reference-based sets, we observed a high level of concordance that varied, as expected, by the relative repeat content of the surrounding genome. Overall, variant calling performance was high in both the MC and PGGB graphs. For example, in relatively unique easy genomic regions constituting 75.42% of the autosomal genome, samples showed a mean of 99.64% recall and 99.64% precision for small variants in the MC graph. Meanwhile, in high-confidence regions (around 90% of autosomal genome), samples showed 97.91% recall and 96.66% precision (Fig.4a). Performance was lower for SVs than for small variants (Fig.4b), as expected, but was still strong. Variant calling performance was lower in highly repetitive genome regions (3.87% of autosomal genome; Fig.4a,b), for which more work will be required to achieve high-quality variant maps. These values are likely to be significant underestimates of variant calling quality, considering known errors in the truth set owing to the inherent limitations of reference-based variant callers (see below). Stratifying the insertion and deletion\u00a0SVs within the pangenome, we observed relatively high levels of agreement with the reference-based methods regardless of length (Fig.4c).",

            "An independent measure of the quality of the pangenome graphs is the extent to which sample haplotype paths through the graph are well supported by the raw sequencing data. When we calculated the number of supporting reads by aligning them to the MC graph using GraphAligner (Methods), more than 97% of HiFi reads were aligned to the MC graph after filtering (Extended Data Fig.4, left). We further calculated the read depth of on-target and off-target edges based on the sample paths in the graph. On average, more than 94% of on-target edges were supported by at least 5\u2009reads, and we observed 2\u2009peaks in the read depth distribution of on-target edges (Extended Data Fig.4, middle): a minor peak corresponding to the edges in heterozygous regions, and a major peak at twice the minor peak corresponding to the edges in homozygous regions. By contrast, only 7% or fewer off-target edges were supported by at least 5\u2009reads (Extended Data Fig.4, right). In addition to HiFi reads, we used ONT reads from 29 out of the 44 samples to perform the same analysis. Even though the data were lower in coverage, similar results were obtained (Supplementary Figs.6and7).",

This result supports the idea that the MC pangenome captures most transcript homologies. When comparing the CAT and Ensembl annotations per assembly, median Jaccard similarities of 0.99 for both genes and transcripts were obtained (Methods).

            "We next turned our attention to complex multiallelic SVs, which have historically been difficult to map using reference-based methods. To screen for complex SVs, we identified bubbles >10\u2009kb from Minigraph that exhibited at least five structural alleles among the assembled haplotypes (Methods). We found that 620 out of 76,506 total sites (0.81%) were complex, and 44 of these overlapped with medically relevant protein-coding genes47(Supplementary Table16). Some are well-known complex SV loci, and all are known to be structurally variable based on previous short-read SV mapping studies10,19,32. However, whereas previous short-read SV calls at these loci are typically imprecise owing to alignment issues and low-resolution read-depth analysis methods, here we resolved their structure at single-base resolution. We selected five clinically relevant complex SV loci for detailed structural analysis:RHD\u2013RHCE,HLA-A,CYP2D6\u2013CYP2D7,C4andLPA(Methods). For each locus and graph, we identified their locations within the graph and then annotated paths within this subgraph with known genes. We traced the individual haplotypes through the subgraph to reveal the structure of each assembly. InCYP2D6\u2013CYP2D7(Extended Data Fig.6),C4(Supplementary Fig.10) andLPA(Supplementary Fig.11), we recapitulated previously described haplotypes. ForCYP2D6\u2013CYP2D7, our calls matched 96% of haplotypes of 76 assemblies called by Cyrius using Illumina short-read data48. Two discrepancies appeared to be caused by errors from Cyrius, and the third was a false duplication in the HG01071-2 pangenome assembly revealed by Flagger. This comparison suggests that the pangenomes faithfully agree with existing knowledge of this complex locus. InRHD\u2013RHCE(Fig.5a\u2013c), in addition to previously described haplotypes, we inferred the presence of five new haplotypes, which included one duplication allele ofRHDand one inversion allele betweenRHDandRHCEthat swaps the last exon of both genes. AroundHLA-A(Fig.5d\u2013fand Supplementary Fig.12), two deletion alleles have been previously described\u2014albeit with imprecise breakpoints10\u2014but an insertion allele carrying aHLA-Ypseudogene was previously unreported.

In general, in the PGGB graph, many SV hotspots, including the centromeres, were transitively collapsed into loops through a subgraph representing a single repeat copy. This feature tends to reduce the size of variants found in repetitive sequences. Assemblies that contained multiple copies of the homologous sequence traversed these nodes a corresponding number of times. By contrast, the MC graph maintained separate copies of these homologous sequences.",
            "Our pangenome reference aims to broadly improve downstream analysis workflows by removing mapping biases that are inherent in the use of a single linear reference genome such as GRCh38 or CHM13. As an initial test case, we studied whether mapping against our pangenomes could improve the accuracy of calling small variants from short reads. We used Giraffe49to align short reads from the GIAB benchmark samples18to the MC pangenome graph. For comparison, we aligned reads to GRCh38 using BWA-MEM50and to Dragen Graph51, which uses GRCh38 augmented with alternative haplotypes at variant sites. We called SNPs and indels with DeepVariant40and the Dragen variant caller51(Methods). Our pangenomic approach (Giraffe plus DeepVariant) outperformed the other approaches for calling small variants (Fig.6a), with gains for both SNPs and indels (Supplementary Fig.14and Supplementary Table17). For example, it made 21,700 errors (false positives or false negatives) in the confident regions of the GIAB truth set using 30\u00d7 reads from HG005. By contrast, 36,144 errors were made when DeepVariant used the reads aligned to GRCh38, and 26,852 errors when using the Dragen pipeline. In challenging medically relevant genes47, the increase in performance was even larger for both SNPs (F1 score, defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, of 0.985 for Giraffe plus DeepVariant compared with <0.976 for the other methods) and indels (F1 score of 0.961 for Giraffe plus DeepVariant compared with <0.958 for the other methods) (Fig.6b). Many regions benefitted from using pangenome mapping, but regions with errors in GRCh38 and large L1HS sequences benefitted the most from the pangenomic approach (Supplementary Figs.15and16).",

Moreover, improvements appeared to be additive to those from the pangenome. For example, DeepTrio using Giraffe alignments gave the highest calling accuracy, with the number of errors decreasing from 21,700 (single sample calling) to 10,098 (trio calling) for HG005.",
            "To create a community resource to aid the development of methods and the analyses of pangenome-based population genetics, we used Giraffe to align high-coverage short-read data from 3,202 samples of the 1KG19to our pangenome graph and DeepVariant to call small variants (Methods). The Mendelian consistency computed across 100 trios from those samples was comparable to the one computed across samples from the GIAB truth set, which indicated that comparable call set quality was obtained (Supplementary Figs.17and18). The number of small variants called was consistently higher across different ancestries, with on average 64,000 more variants per sample compared with the 1KG catalogue (Extended Data Fig.7a). Given that our pangenome-based calls showed improved performance in challenging regions (Fig.6b), this call set across the 1KG cohort now provides the genetics and genomics communities with AF estimates for complex but medically relevant loci.

            "The ability to represent polymorphic SVs is a key advantage of a graph-based pangenome reference. To demonstrate the utility of the sequence-resolved SVs inherent to our pangenome, we used PanGenie54to genotype the bubbles in the MC graph. We decomposed bubbles into their constituent variant alleles (Supplementary Figs.20and21) and found that 22,133,782 bubbles represented 20,194,117 SNP alleles, 6,848,115 indel alleles and 413,809 SV alleles (Supplementary Fig.22andMethods).

            "Next we genotyped the 3,202 samples from the 1KG19(Methods). We filtered the resulting SV genotypes using a machine-learning approach5,54that assessed different statistics, including Mendelian consistency and concordance, to assembly based calls. As a result, we produced a filtered, high-quality subset of SV genotypes containing 28,434 deletion alleles, 84,752 insertion alleles and 26,439 other SV alleles (Supplementary Table18andMethods). Many of the alleles not included in the filtered set stemmed from complex, multiallelic loci and were enriched for rare alleles. As independent quality control measures for genotypes in the filtered set, we assessed the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium values (Supplementary Figs.23\u201325) and compared AFs observed across the genotypes of all 2,504 unrelated samples to the respective AFs of the 44 assembly samples (88 haplotypes) contained in the graph. Pearson correlation values of 0.96, 0.93 and 0.90 for the deletion, insertion and other SV alleles, respectively, were observed (Fig.6c), which indicated the high quality of the genotypes. To quantify our ability to detect additional SVs, we compared our filtered set of genotypes to the HGSVC PanGenie genotypes (v.2.0 \u2018lenient\u2019 set)5and the Illumina-based 1KG SV call set19. We analysed the number of detected SV alleles in each sample (homozygous or heterozygous) and stratified them by genome annotations from GIAB (Fig.6dandMethods) as well as using our own more detailed annotations (Supplementary Fig.26). Both of the PanGenie-based call sets detected more SVs (HPRC, 18,483 SVs per sample; HGSVC, 12,997 SVs per sample) than the short-read-based 1KG call set (9,596 SVs per sample), with a particularly substantial advance for deletions <300\u2009bp and insertions (Fig.6e). The respective average numbers of SVs per haplotype were 12,439 for HPRC, 9,227 for HGSVC and 6,099 for the 1KG calls (Supplementary Fig.27); that is, a gain of 104.0% for HPRC over 1KG and of 34.8% over HGSVC. This result confirms that short-read-based SV discovery relative to a linear reference genome misses a large proportion of SVs5,6,8. As anticipated, the number of SVs per sample within \u2018easy\u2019 genomic regions was consistent across all three call sets, particularly in low-mappability and tandem repeat regions, and the use of our pangenome reference led to substantial gains (Fig.6d), including for common variants (Fig.6eand Supplementary Fig.28). Although the newly identified SVs were harder to genotype because they are primarily located in repetitive regions, genotype concordances were high and close to the ones for known SVs (Supplementary Fig.29).",
            "VNTRs are particularly variable among individuals and are challenging to access with short reads. The gains in the number of genotyped SVs in VNTRs (Fig.6dand Supplementary Fig.28) prompted us to investigate whether our pangenome reference could also improve read mapping in VNTR regions. We first established orthology mapping between haplotypes in our pangenome reference using danbing-tk55. The orthology can be established for 94,452 out of the 98,021 VNTR loci (96.4%) discovered by TRF56. When mapping simulated short reads to GRCh38 with BWA-MEM, the rate of unmapped reads was 6.6\u20138.5 times greater compared with mapping to the MC graph with Giraffe (Extended Data Fig.10a, Supplementary Fig.30and Supplementary Table19). The true negatives were on average 1.9% higher than the GRCh38 approach, and the true positives were on average 0.087% higher. The graph approach also reduced false negatives by 2.1-fold. Read depth over a locus is correlated with the copy number of a duplication and we evaluated how well length variants in VNTR regions can be estimated using either the MC graph or GRCh38. The graph approach performed better for 80% of the loci (48,085 out of 60,386) and increased the medianr2from 0.58 to 0.70 (Supplementary Fig.31).",

            "To evaluate the benefit of our pangenome reference on transcriptomics, we simulated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads and mapped them to a pangenome and to a standard reference genome (Methods). The pangenome-based pipeline using vg mpmap57achieved significantly lower false mapping rates than a linear reference pipeline using either vg mpmap or STAR58(Extended Data Fig.10b). Compared with the linear reference pipelines, the pangenome pipeline also showed reduced allelic bias and increased mapped coverage on heterozygous variants, which could benefit studies of allele-specific expression (Supplementary Fig.32). With real sequencing data, mapping rates were more difficult to interpret in the absence of a ground truth (Supplementary Fig.33). Instead, we focused on the correlation in exon coverage to independent PacBio long-read Iso-Seq data. The analysis showed that the correlation was highest when mapping to a spliced pangenome graph derived from the MC graph (Supplementary Fig.34). The pangenome pipeline showed a modest increase in correlation over the linear reference pipelines (0.006\u20130.011). In addition, mapping the simulated reads to the MC graph led to improved gene expression estimates relative to the linear GRCh38, regardless of whether alternative contigs were included in GRCh38 (Supplementary Fig.35).",

Overall, we observed a net increase in the number of peak calls, whereby, on average, 2\u20133% of peaks were found only when using the MC pangenome (Extended Data Fig.10c). Moreover, the newly found peaks were replicated in more samples than expected by chance (Supplementary Fig.36). In addition, we recovered epigenomic features that were specific to SV alleles not present in GRCh38 (termed non-reference). For example, across all H3K4me1 datasets, we assigned 1,326 events to the non-reference SV allele, 1,443 to the reference allele and 2,008 to both alleles within heterozygous SVs (Extended Data Fig.10d), with some replicated multiple times across samples (Supplementary Fig.37). Of these, there were 194 SVs with peaks that were observed only in African ancestry genomes, 150 that were observed only in European ancestry genomes and 216 that were observed in both African and European ancestry genomes.

This provides a large set of fully phased human genome assemblies and outperforms earlier efforts on many levels of assembly quality5,16,60. For example, compared with Ebert et al.5, the average median base level accuracy is nearly an order of magnitude higher, the N50 contiguity is nearly double and the structural accuracy is higher33. These improvements are the result of recent improvements in de novo assembly driven both by better sequencing technology and coordinated innovations in assembly algorithms20,21. To validate assembly structural accuracy, we developed a new pipeline that maps low error, long reads to each diploid assembly to support the predicted haplotypes. This pipeline indicated that more than 99% of each assembly, and greater than 90% of the assembled sequence representing highly repetitive arrays, was structurally correct. Some challenges around loci that harbour copy number polymorphisms and/or inversions remained33. Although the focus of this effort was to build a reference resource, highly accurate haplotype-resolved assemblies enabled us to access previously inaccessible regions, highlighting new forms of genetic variation and providing new insights into mutational processes such as interlocus gene conversion53.",

These contained genes known to have CNVs associated with human health, including amylase61(four to ten copies), \u03b2-defensin62(three to seven copies,DEFB107A) andNOTCH2NLC\u2013NOTCH2NLB63(one additional copy).",
            "The pangenomes presented here are both a set of individual haploid genome assemblies and an alignment of these assemblies. The combination can be efficiently described as a variation graph14,64. A new set of exchange formats for pangenomics, including extensions of the graphical fragment format (GFA) that encode variation graphs, are emerging34. An associated article65to this work demonstrated that the pangenomes presented here can be losslessly stored using a compressed, binary representation of GFA in just 3\u20136\u2009GB despite representing more than 282\u2009billion bases of individual sequence, with strongly sublinear scaling as new genomes are added. Creating pangenome graphs is an active research topic, so we developed multiple pipelines, and details of these methods are further explored in companion papers35,36. We found concordance between the different construction approaches used here, whereby the MC and PGGB pangenomes contained nearly the same number of small variants and SVs of various types. Furthermore, these encoded pangenome variants showed high levels of agreement with existing linear reference-based methods for variant discovery, particularly within the non-repetitive fraction of the genome. Our study of complex and medically relevant loci showed that the pangenomes faithfully recapitulated existing knowledge and will enable future efforts to study the role of complex variation in human disease. Further work will be required to more comprehensively identify medically relevant complex SVs and to ensure the accuracy of each allele represented in the pangenome.",
            "Where the pangenome graphs differ is principally in how they handle CNV sequences. The PGGB method will frequently merge CNVs, whereas the MC graphs represent CNV copies as independent subgraphs. Both approaches have merits, and which approach to favour will take further experimentation and community input, and may vary by the specific application. The PGGB method retained all centromeric and satellite sequences, whereas the MC graph pruned much of this sequence. This made it practical with current methods to use the MC graphs for read alignment applications. However, pruning these sequences is not a satisfactory solution. Longer term, more work is needed to determine how best to align and represent these large repeat arrays within pangenomes, particularly as T2T assembly becomes commonplace and these arrays therefore completed. Furthermore, although the PGGB graph retained centromeric and satellite sequences, in principle, by enabling analysis of previously inaccessible parts of the pangenome, our initial population-genetic analysis of these regions (Methods) leaves open questions about assembly accuracy and alignment, especially in areas of the genome where mutation rates are thought to be an order of magnitude greater66. This suggests that significant care must be taken when studying them, and new methods may need to be developed to fully understand and characterize this component of the human pangenome.",
            "A near-term application of pangenome references will be to improve reference-based sequence mapping workflows. In these workflows, the pangenome can act as a drop-in replacement for existing references, with the read mappings projected from the pangenome space back onto an existing linear reference for downstream processing. This is how the Giraffe\u2013DeepVariant workflow functions: DeepVariant, the variant caller, never needs to consider the complexity of the pangenome, but the workflow benefits from a mapping step that accounts for sequences that are missing from the linear reference. Making the switch to using pangenome mapping is not significantly more computationally expensive49and resulted in an average 34% reduction in false-positive and false-negative errors compared with using the standard reference methods (Supplementary Fig.38). These benefits were also greatest at complex loci47. Pangenomes not only improve variant calling but also improve transcript mapping accuracy57and detection of ChIP-seq peaks67.",
            "SVs have been mostly excluded from short-read studies because methods to genotype them using a linear reference have limited accuracy and sensitivity. Previous short-read, linear reference studies have discovered 7,500\u20139,500 SVs per sample19,68, whereas long-read sequencing efforts have routinely discovered around 25,000. Ebert et al.5showed that using PanGenie, a pangenomic approach, with 32 samples, a subset of these variants could be genotyped in short-read genomes (about 13,000 genotyped on average, ranging from 12,000 to 15,000 per sample). Using the same PanGenie method, the HPRC pangenome increases this to around 18,500 (ranging from 16,900 to 24,900) per sample, enabling the genotyping of the substantial majority of SVs discovered using long-reads per sample. The draft pangenome therefore delivers better SV calling than previous approaches, extracting latent information from short-read samples that are already available. So, in the future, the pangenome will enable the inclusion of tens of thousands of additional SV alleles into genome-wide association studies. Looking beyond short reads, in the future, the combination of the pangenome and low-cost long-read sequencing should prove to be a potent combination for comprehensive SV genotyping.",
            "These new pangenomic workflows could benefit individuals of different ancestries differently. For read mapping and small variant calling, we observed a consistent improvement across individuals (Extended Data Fig.7). Moreover, the pangenome might improve SV genotyping differently across individuals owing to the stronger divergence of the alleles from the reference. In the 1KG cohort, we observed that the genotyped samples clustered by super-population labels (Extended Data Fig.11), which would suggest different levels of detection bias that are mitigated with the pangenome. However, we caution that the composition of the samples underlying the pangenome relative to the composition of the set of samples genotyped could potentially influence these results; an analysis with more samples is warranted.",

            "The openly accessible, diverse assemblies and pangenome graphs we present here form a draft of a pangenome reference. There are many remaining challenges to growing and refining this reference. For example, assembly reliability analysis revealed roughly an order of magnitude more erroneously assembled sequences in the HPRC assemblies than in the T2T-CHM13 complete assembly. Similarly, in a companion analysis, Strand-seq data from a subset of assemblies revealed 6\u20137\u2009Mb of incorrectly oriented sequence per haplotype33, which indicates that there is room to structurally improve the assemblies. Furthermore, despite being predicted to have less than 1\u2009base error per around 200,000 assembled bases, base level sequencing errors are still an issue. For example, we identified more than a dozen apparent frameshifts and nonsense mutations per genome annotation that are probably the result of sequencing errors. The cohort we present is also relatively small notwithstanding the significant effort to generate the underlying long-read sequencing resource. Our near-term goal is to expand the pangenome to a diverse cohort of 350 individuals (which should capture most common variants), to push towards T2T genomes for this cohort (to properly represent the entire genome in almost all individuals) and to refine the pangenome alignment methods (so that telomere-to-telomere alignment is possible, capturing more complex regions of the genome). This will give us a more comprehensive representation of all types of human variation.",
            "We acknowledge that references generated from the 1KG samples alone are insufficient to capture the extent of sequence diversity in the human population. To ensure that we are able to maximize our surveys of sample diversity while abiding by principles of community engagement and avoiding extractive practices14,15, we will broaden our efforts to recruit new participants to improve the representation of human genetic diversity. A richer human reference map promises to improve our understanding of genomics and our ability to predict, diagnose and treat disease. A more diverse human reference map should also help ensure that the eventual applications of genomic research and precision medicine are effective for all populations. We recognize that the value of this project will partly be in the future establishment of new standards for how we capture variant diversity, the opportunity to disseminate science into diverse communities and continued efforts to engage with diverse voices in this ambitious goal to build a common global reference resource. The methods we are developing should prove valuable for other species. Indeed, other groups are pioneering such efforts69,70. In parallel with our efforts to obtain a more comprehensive collection of diverse and highly accurate human reference genomes, we anticipate further optimization and rapid improvement of the pangenome reference, enabling an increasingly broad set of applications and use cases for both the research and clinical communities.",
            "We identified parent\u2013child trios from the 1KG in which the child cell line banked within the NHGRI Sample Repository for Human Genetic Research at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research was listed as having zero expansions and two or fewer passages, and rank-ordered representative individuals as follows. Loci with MAFs less than 0.05 were removed. MAFs were measured in the full cohort (that is, 2,504 individuals, 26 subpopulations) regardless of each individual\u2019s subpopulation labelling. For each chromosome, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for dimension reduction. This resulted in a matrix with 2,200 features, which was then centred and scaled using smartPCA normalization. The matrix was further reduced to 100 features through another round of PCA.",
            "We defined the representative individuals of a subpopulation as those who are similar to the other members in the group (which, in this scenario, is the subpopulation they belong to), as well as different from individuals outside the group. Group is defined by previous 1KG population labels (for example, \u2018Gambian in Western Division\u2019). We did this as follows. For each sample, we first calculated the intragroup distancedintra, which is the average of L2-norms between the sample and samples of the same subpopulation. The intergroup distance,dinter, was similarly defined as the average of L2-norms between the sample and samples from all other subpopulations. The L2-norms were derived in the feature space of the PCA. The score of this sample was then defined as 10\u2009\u00d7dintra+dinter/(n\u20131), wherenis the number of subpopulations. For each subpopulation, if fewer than three trios were available, all were selected. Otherwise, trios were sorted by ranking children with max(paternalrank, maternalrank), where paternalrankand maternalrankare the respective ranks of each parent\u2019s score, selecting the three trios with a maximum value. We ranked by parent scores because during the year\u20091 effort, the child samples did not have sequencing data and therefore had to be represented by the parents.",
            "Ideally, we would have selected the same number of candidates from each subpopulation and have an equal number of candidates from both sexes. To correct for imbalances, we applied the following criteria for each subpopulation\u2019s candidate set: (1) when the sex was unbalanced (that is, off by more than one sample), we tried to swap in the next-best candidate of the less represented sex or did nothing if this was not possible; (2) if a subpopulation had fewer individuals than the desired sample selection size (that is, all candidates were selected), their unused slots were distributed to other unsaturated subpopulations. The latter choice is arbitrary but should have little impact on the overall results.",

Next 350\u2009\u00b5l of ONT LFB was added to the tube and mixed by gentle tapping 5 times. The tube was then spun for 1\u20132\u2009s using a microcentrifuge and placed on a magnetic rack. The ONT LFB was removed and discarded. Next the Nanobind disk was washed by adding 350\u2009\u00b5l ONT LFB. The tube was gently tapped 5 times to move LFB over the surface of the disk. The tube was then incubated at room temperature for 5\u2009min. The tube was then spun for 1\u20132\u2009s using a microcentrifuge and placed on a magnetic rack.

The tube was incubated for 30\u2009min at room temperature, then gently tapped 5\u201310 times and incubated for an additional 1\u20132\u2009h at room temperature. The eluate was then transferred to a new 1.5\u2009ml Eppendorf DNA Lo-Bind tube using a wide-bore P200 pipette using the same technique described above for passing the eluate over the Nanobind disk before removing the eluate from the tube. The mixture was then pipette mixed 2\u20133 times with a wide-bore P200 pipette. The library was stored overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C before sequencing to facilitate maximal dissolution of DNA.",

Each aspiration of 150\u2009\u00b5l took 10\u201320\u2009s, and each dispense of 150\u2009\u00b5l took 10\u201320\u2009s. Samples were then incubated at room temperature for 10\u2009min. Next the samples were pipette mixed 8 times with a wide-bore P200 pipette set to 150\u2009\u00b5l. Before loading the library, the flow cell was primed with flush buffer/flush tether mixture per ONT directions. The library was then added to the flow cell. The mixture was viscous but loaded smoothly in about 1\u2009min. Some samples took 2\u2009min maximum to load. The sequencing run had a re-mux time set for every 6\u2009h.

First, we aliquoted 1\u2009million cells for fixation with formaldehyde and DSG. We digested chromatin with DNAse\u2009I until DNA fragments of a desired length were obtained. Per the protocol, we performed end repair on the chromatin, followed by ligation of a biotinylated bridge oligonucleotide, followed by ligation of free chromatin ends. We reversed crosslinks and purified proximity ligated DNA. We converted the DNA into an Illumina sequencing library using a NEB Ultra II library preparation kit (NEB) with a Y-adaptor. We enriched for ligation products using streptavidin bead capture on the final library. Each capture reaction was then split into two replicates before the final PCR enrichment step to preserve complexity.

Asmgene does not distinguish between true duplicates and errors. Looking at its results, we were able to find the duplication trend and detect any outlier. This assessment acted as a proxy for detecting high-level duplication errors. We used the Ensembl v.99 cDNA sequences77as the input gene set for running asmgene.",
            "Three samples were detected as outliers in terms of the number of gene duplications. To identify the cause of this issue, we aligned back the HiFi reads to those assemblies and checked the depth of coverages and mapping qualities. It showed that the samples HG01358, HG01123 and HG002 contained false duplications in at least one haplotype of length around 55\u2009Mb (in h1tg000058l contig), about 14\u2009Mb (h1tg000013l) and around 70\u2009Mb (h2tg000045l), respectively. In the assembly graphs of HG01358 and HG01123, the duplicated HiFi reads that appeared multiple times were used as anchors to manually determine the exact boundaries of the duplicated regions in the contigs. These two contigs were then manually fixed by breaking the contigs at the duplication start and end points and discarding the duplicated sequence from the assembly. In detail, for HG01123 for h1tg000013l, we discarded the interval [94439457, contig end]. For HG01358 for h1tg000058l, we kept the interval [0, 95732608), renaming the contig to h1tg000058l_1, we discarded the interval [95732608, 150395342) and kept the interval [150395342, contig end], renaming it to h1tg000058l_2.

It contained an approximately 22-Mb-long paternal block in the middle of the contig, which resulted in two switch errors at the edges of this block. This block was manually discarded from the assembly and the contig was broken into two smaller ones. In detail, in HG02080 for the h2tg000053l contig, we kept the interval [0, 41506503), renaming it to h2tg000053l_1, we discarded the interval\u00a0[41506503, 63683095) and kept the interval [63683095,\u00a0contig end], renaming it to h2tg000053l_2.",

These contigs were then dropped from the assemblies using a WDLized version of samtools faidx. It is worth noting that the contigs with nuclear mitochondrial DNAs within them were not dropped.",
            "In the last cleaning step, we selected one contig as the best mitochondrial contig per diploid assembly. To do this, selection we aligned the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (with the RefSeq identifier ofNC_012920.1) to each diploid assembly using minimap2 with the parameters -cx asm5 --cs. Then we selected one contig with the highest mapping score and the lowest number of mismatches as the best mitochondrial contig (we selected one randomly if multiple best contigs existed). This contig was then rotated and flipped (if necessary) to match the start and orientation ofNC_012920.1.fa and then added to the maternal assembly of the corresponding sample. Only the HG01071 sample did not produce any identifiable mitochondrial contig.",

For example, a contig assigned the nameJAGYVH010000025in sample HG02257\u2019s maternal assembly was renamed to be HG02257#2#JAGYVH010000025.

In the process of downloading from GenBank, three of the assemblies (HG00733 paternal, HG02630 paternal and NA21309 maternal) had their downloads prematurely stopped, which resulted in missing sequences. Notably, NA21309 is missing its mitochondrial contig. Details can be found on the HPRC\u2019s year\u20091 assembly GitHub repository (https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies).

We evaluated the HG002 and HG005 HPRC assemblies aligned to GRCh38. Variants were called from assemblies using Dipcall (v.0.3) (using mimimap2 (v.2.2.4))38. We used -z200000,10000 parameter to improve alignment contiguity, as it was previously shown to improve variant recall in regions with dense variation, such as the major histocompatibility complex81. Small variant evaluation was performed using hap.py (v.3.15)82, benchmarking against v.4.2.1 of high-confidence SNP, small indel and homozygous reference calls for the GIAB samples HG002 and HG005. Comparisons were performed with and without restriction to the associated dipcall region file (dip.bed) to assess recall within and outside assembled regions.

Switch error describes the number of times two adjacent phased variants incorrectly switch between maternal and paternal haplotypes.

Yak generates phasing statistics separately for each haplotype using parentalk-mers gathered from Illumina short-read sequencing of the parents.",

            "An alternative approach for phasing evaluation is to use Hi-C reads that do not require trio information. We computed the switch error rate for local phasing evaluation and the Hamming error rate for global phasing evaluation. We implemented an efficientk-mer-based method in pstools (v.0.1)24and used maximum Hi-C read support to detect switch errors on heterozygous positions. In this procedure, we first identified heterozygousk-mers (hets) from phased assemblies using 31-mers. Then we mapped Hi-C reads to the assemblies using these 31-mers. If there were >5 reads that supported a switch between consecutive hets in assemblies, we considered a haplotype switch. For each het pair, we noted whether Hi-C reads supported or did not support the phase. We considered a switch error when a het site had a phase switched support relative to that of the previous heterozygous site. The switch error rate is the number of local switches divided by the number of heterozygous sites. We performed this operation for the entire contig over all contigs for switch calculations. For the Hamming error calculations, we considered Hamming distance on the entire contig level divided by the number of heterozygous sites. This measure gives a global view of phasing errors and implicitly penalizes any long switches in contigs.",

            "To exclude unreliable alignments, we removed all chimeric alignments and alignments shorter than 2\u2009kb or with a gap-compressed mismatch ratios higher than 1%. As the assembly is diploid and the reads aligned to the homozygous regions are expected to have low mapping qualities, we did not filter alignments on the basis of their mapping qualities. In Supplementary Fig.41, we plot the histograms of mapping qualities and the distributions of alignment identities for one sample, HG00438, as an example. The statistics of three sets of alignments were plotted: the alignments to the diploid assembly and to each haploid assembly (maternal and paternal) separately. It indicates that the reads have higher identities when the diploid assembly is used as reference but about 20% more reads have mapping qualities lower than 10.",
            "Generally, in highly homozygous regions, the aligner may not be able to select the correct haplotype as the primary alignment because of either read errors or misassemblies. To detect these cases, we searched for secondary alignments for which the scores were almost as high as the primary alignment of the same read. For each such read, we made a pseudo-multiple alignment of the read sequence and the assembly blocks captured by all secondary and primary alignments. Using this alignment, we searched for the read bases that were mismatched in at least one alignment but not all alignments. We called such bases single nucleotide markers. For each alignment, we calculated a consistency score by considering only the single nucleotide markers and taking the summation of their base qualities with a negative sign. We then sorted the alignments (regardless of being primary or secondary) based on this score. If the best alignment was a secondary alignment, we assigned the primary tag to this alignment and removed the other alignments. The percentage of the total reads with swapped alignments ranged from 0.03% (HG03453) to 0.44% (HG005) across 47 HPRC samples. This result shows that only a small percentage of the reads needed to be relocalized using this method. This step was performed through the Secphase (v.0.1) workflow, which is available in the Dockstore collection (https://dockstore.org/organizations/HumanPangenome/collections/Flagger-Secphase).",
            "By calling variants, it is possible to detect the regions that either need polishing (that is, are errors) or that have alignments from the wrong haplotype because of mismappings. We used DeepVariant (v.1.3.0) with the parameter --model_type=\u201cPACBIO\u201d to call variants on these alignments. The variants were then filtered to include only the biallelic SNPs with a variant frequency higher than 0.3 and genotype quality higher than 10.",
            "Having the biallelic SNPs, we found the alignments with alternative alleles and removed them from the bam file. For this step, we implemented and used the program filter_alt_reads, running the following command:",
            "To assess the read mappings resulting from our diploid alignment process, we used the following five steps, which are combined into a pipeline that we refer to as Flagger. Flagger essentially fits a mixture model to successive coverage blocks of the read-to-diploid assembly alignment and then classifies each block to a category predicting the accuracy of the assembly at that location.",
            "First, after producing and cleaning the HiFi alignments, we calculated the depth of coverage for each assembly base by samtools depth -aa (the -aa option allows outputting the bases with zero coverage):",
            "The output of samtools depth was then converted into a more efficient format with the .cov suffix. This format is implemented specifically for Flagger and is more efficient, as the consecutive bases with the same coverage take only one line. We implemented a program called depth2cov for converting the output of samtools depth to the .cov format.",
            "In the second step, the frequencies of coverages were calculated using cov2counts. The output file with the .count suffix is a two-column tab-delimited file: the first column shows coverages and the second column shows the frequencies of those coverages.",
            "The python script fit_gmm.py takes a file .counts suffix, fits a Gaussian mixture model and finds the best parameters through expectation-maximization. This mixture model consists of four main components and each component represents a specific type of region:",
            "Erroneous component, which is modelled by a Poisson distribution. To avoid overfitting, this mode only uses the coverages below 10 so its mean is limited to be between 0 and 10. It represents the regions with very low read support.",
            "(Falsely) duplicated component, which is modelled by a Gaussian distribution, the mean of which is constrained to be half of mean of the haploid component. It should mainly represent the falsely duplicated regions.",

            "It was noted that the model components may change for different regions owing to regional coverage differences and that the resulting systematic differences affect the accuracy of the partitioning process. To make the coverage thresholds more sensitive to the local patterns, the diploid assembly was split into windows of length (5\u201310\u2009Mb) and a distinct model was fit for each window. Before fitting, we split the whole-genome coverage file produced in the first step into multiple coverage files for each window. We implemented and ran split_cov_by_window for splitting:",
            "This produced a list of coverage files, each of which ends with ${CONTIG_NAME}_${WINDOW_START}_${WINDOW_END}.cov",
            "We then repeated the above-described steps for each resulting coverage file.",
            "One important observation is that for short contigs, the coverage distribution is generally too noisy to satisfactorily fit the mixture model. To address this issue, we performed the window-specific coverage analysis only for the contigs longer than 5\u2009Mb. For the shorter contigs, we used the results of the whole-genome analysis.",
            "Using the fitted model, we assigned each coverage value to one of the four components (erroneous, duplicated, haploid and collapsed). To do so for each coverage value, we picked the component with the highest probability. For example, the coverage value 0 is frequently assigned to the erroneous component. In Supplementary Fig.42, the coverage intervals are coloured based on their assigned component.",
            "According to an article describing a complete human genome3, there are some satellite arrays (for example, HSat1, HSat2 and HSat3) for which the HiFi coverage drops or increases systematically owing to biases in sample preparation and sequencing. Such platform-specific biases mislead the pipeline. As a result, the falsely duplicated component may contain a mixture of falsely duplicated and coverage-biased blocks. Similar effects occur for the collapsed component.",
            "To incorporate such coverage biases and to correct the results in the corresponding regions, we first found the regions of each haploid assembly for which a coverage bias is expected. To find such regions, we lifted over the CHM13 HSat1, HSat2 and HSat3 annotation to each assembly by aligning the assembly contigs to the reference T2T-CHM13 (v.1.1) and GRCh38 (chromosome\u2009Y) and projecting the HSat coordinates back to the assembly (using python script project_blocks.py). Then we ran fit_gmm.py to fit a mixture model for the blocks assigned to each HSat type and adjusted the parameter --coverage, the starting point of the expectation-maximization process, based on the expected coverage in the corresponding HSat. For HSat1, HSat2 and HSat3 we set --coverage to 0.75, 1.25 and 1.25 times the average sequencing coverage, respectively. Finally, we decomposed each HSat based on the inferred coverage thresholds and replaced the previous assigned component by the new one.",
            "In some cases, the duplicated component was mixed up with the haploid one. It usually happens when the coverage in the haploid component drops systematically or the majority of a long contig is falsely duplicated. To address this issue, we used another indicator of a false duplication, which is the accumulation of alignments with very low mapping quality (MAPQ). We produced another coverage file using only the alignments with MAPQ\u2009>\u200920. Whenever we found a region flagged as duplicated with more than five high-quality alignments, we changed the flag to haploid.",

            "To estimate the false-positive rate of Flagger, we applied it to the T2T-CHM13 (v.1.1) reference. The direct output of Flagger showed that about 12.77\u2009Mb (around 0.41%) of the T2T-CHM13 reference assembly was flagged as potentially unreliable. The HPRC assemblies were almost free of rDNA arrays, but there were modelled sequences for rDNA arrays in the T2T-CHM13 (v.1.1) reference. These arrays were flagged as falsely duplicated in their entirety, which indicated that Flagger with HiFi reads may not be able to correctly evaluate rDNA arrays. Therefore, to make a fair comparison, we excluded rDNA arrays (about 9.92\u2009Mb in total) from the reference evaluation, which decreased the number of unreliable bases to 5.58\u2009Mb (around 0.18%). We additionally identified about 2.76\u2009Mb of a region beside chromosome\u20091\u2013HSat2 that was mis-flagged as collapsed. This mis-flagging was the impact of the systematic coverage rise on the neighbouring HSat2 that altered the fitted mixture model. By manually fixing this mis-flagging, we had about 2.82\u2009Mb (0.09%) of unreliable blocks in T2T-CHM13 (v.1.1). This number is about 9.3\u2009times lower than the average for the HPRC assemblies. These unreliable blocks are mainly a combination of \u2018Unknown\u2019 blocks, which could not be properly assigned and the regions with HiFi-specific coverage drops.

Furthermore, the chromosome\u2009Y added to T2T-CHM13 is from the HPRC HG002 sample; therefore chromosome\u2009Y was excluded. For each class of unreliable region (unknown, erroneous, duplicated, collapsed and haploid), we calculated the average number of base pairs overlapping SDs across the haplotype assemblies and annotated each 5\u2009kb window with the most representative overlapping SD (the SD with the highest product of identity and length). Then using the most representative SD, we calculated the average length and identity of SDs overlapping each class of unreliable region for all the 94 haplotypes and compared the length of identity of SDs that overlapped the different types of errors in the assembly.

This resulted in both clustered genes and non-clustered genes (genes were considered not clustered when there was only one gene within the window). The regions to map were then identified on the basis of the start of the most 5\u2032\u2009gene and the end of the most 3\u2032\u2009gene in each cluster (or simply the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032\u2009end of the gene in the case of non-clustered genes).",

The selected hit or hits were then extended on the basis of how much of the original reference gene they covered to ensure that minor local variants between the reference and target regions did not lead to the target region being truncated. Once extended, the remaining hits were then clustered on the basis of genomic overlap and merged into unique regions.

When it was not possible to resolve a conflict between two genes, both were kept. This concluded the primary mapping process.",

New SVs of at least 50\u2009bp detected in the mapping can then be added to the graph. To construct a pangenome graph, one chosen reference assembly, GRCh38 in this case, was used as a starting graph, and the mapping and SV addition steps were repeated for each additional assembly, greedily. This iterative approach is analogous to partial order alignment (POA)89. Graphs constructed in this way describe the structural variation within the samples and provide a coordinate system across the reference and all insertions. Minigraph does not produce self-alignments. That is, it will never align a portion of the reference assembly onto another portion of the reference assembly. In this way all reference positions have a unique location within the created pangenome. Minigraph (v.0.14) was used with -xggs options. The input order was GRCh38, CHM13 then the remainder in lexicographic order by sample name.",

Doing so allows the graph to comprehensively represent most variation, as well as to embed the input haplotypes within it as paths, which is important for some applications49. To remove noisy alignments from the MC pangenome, long (\u2265100\u2009kb) non-reference sequences identified as being satellite, unassignable to a reference chromosome or which appear unaligned to the remainder of the assemblies were removed from the graph. This resulted in a pangenome with significantly reduced complexity that nevertheless maintained all sequences of the starting reference assembly and the large majority of those in the additional haplotypes.

To avoid introducing misleading interchromosomal events, and because it is necessary to run the subsequent steps individually on chromosomes owing to memory requirements, the mappings were divided by reference chromosome. This was done by splitting the Minigraph into connected components and using the RN tags to determine their corresponding chromosome names. The PAF mappings were used to determine the coverage of each query contig with each chromosome component. This coverage was used to assign each query contig to a single chromosome by choosing the chromosome with the highest coverage.

When aligning different species, it uses a phylogenetic tree to progressively decompose the alignment into a subproblem for each ancestral node in the tree. We adapted it to also accept chromosome-scale sequence-to-Minigraph mappings as produced above, and improved its runtime on alignments of many sequences by replacing its base aligner with abPOA91. The core algorithm described in ref.37remains unchanged, whereby the pairwise alignments were used to induce a sequence graph, then filtered using the Cactus alignment filtering algorithm, and components of unaligned sequence were then processed by the base alignment and refinement algorithm. The resulting graph was used to infer an ancestral sequence (not explicitly used in this work) and then exported to a hierarchical alignment (HAL) file92. We implemented a converter, hal2vg93that converts the HAL alignment into a sequence graph in VG format.",

First, unaligned sequences >10\u2009kb in length, including sequences not aligned to Minigraph, were removed to filter out any under-alignment artefacts that might later be mistaken for insertions. Next, GFAffix94was used to normalize the graphs by merging together redundant node prefixes and suffixes. Nodes were flipped as necessary to ensure that reference paths always visit their forward orientations. The chromosomes were combined into a whole-genome graph, indexed and exported to VCF, all using vg. Patched versions of both the GRCh38-based and CHM13-based graphs were created when it was discovered that short contigs split-mapping to distant locations had induced large deletions. The deletions were removed using vg clip -D 10000000 (and the pipeline has since been corrected to no longer produce them). Allele-filtered graphs, used for short-read mapping, were produced (from the patched graphs) by removing all nodes traversed by fewer than 9 haplotype paths (minimum AF\u2009=\u200910%) using vg clip -d 9 -m 10000.

We applied it to build a pangenome graph from all genome assemblies and references (both GRCh38 and CHM13). The resulting PGGB graph represents all alignment relationships between input genomes in a single graph. The PGGB graph is a lossless model of the input assemblies that represents all equivalently. This arrangement enables all of our pangenome assemblies to be used as reference systems, a property that we used to explore the scope of pangenome variation in a total way. Owing to ambiguous placement of variation in all-to-all pairwise alignments, many SV hotspots, including the centromeres, are transitively collapsed into loops through a subgraph representing a single repeat copy, a feature that tends to reduce the size of variants found in repetitive sequences. In contrast to MC, PGGB does not filter rapidly evolving satellite sequences or the regions that do not reliably align. This increases its size and complexity relative to the MC graph and adds a significant amount of singleton sequences relative to the Minigraph and MC graphs. However, this property enables annotations and coordinates of all assemblies in the pangenome to be related to the graph structure and utilized in subsequent downstream analyses. We applied the PGGB model to investigate the full pangenome and integrate annotations established de novo on the diverse assemblies into a single model for analyses of pangenome diversity and of complex structurally variable loci (MHC and 8p inversion).",

This method, wfmash, applies the mapping algorithm of MashMap2 to find homologies at a specified length and per\u2009cent identity. It then derives base-level alignments using a high-order version of the WFA algorithm (wflign), which first aligns sequences in segments of 256\u2009bp, then patches up the base-level alignment with local application of WFA. wfmash was designed and developed specifically for the problem of building all-to-all alignments for large pangenomes. (2) Graph induction: the input FASTA sequences and PAF-format alignments produced by wfmash are converted to a graph (in GFA format) using seqwish96. This losslessly transforms the input alignments and sequences into a graph. (3) Graph normalization: we applied a normalization algorithm\u2014smoothxg97\u2014to simplify complex motifs that occur in STRs and other repetitive sequences, as well as to mitigate underalignment. The graph is first sorted using a path-guided stochastic gradient descent method98that organizes the graph in one-dimension to optimize path distances and graph distances. This sort provides a way to partition the graph into smaller pieces over which we applied a multiple sequence alignment algorithm (abPOA)91. These pieces were laced back into a final graph. We iterated this process twice using different target POA lengths to remove boundary effects caused at the borders of the MSA problems. Finally, we applied GFAffix94to remove redundant furcations from the topology of the graph.",

Contigs that did not map under this arrangement were then partitioned using a split-mapping approach, requiring 90% identity over 50\u2009kb to seed the mappings, and putting the contig into the chromosome bin for which it had the best split mapping. We thus initially partition the data into 25 chromosome sets: one for each autosome, one for each sex chromosome, and finally the mitochondria.",

To develop a robust process to build the HPRC graph, the PGGB team iterated the build 88 times. The final chromosome graphs were compacted into a single ID space using vg ids -j, then for each reference (GRCh38 and CHM13) a combined VCF file was generated from the graph with vg deconstruct (v.1.36.0/commit 375cad7).",

To reduce complexity, and false-positive SNPs resulting from misaligned regions, we applied a minimum match length filter (in seqwish) of 311\u2009bp. This meant that the graph that we induced was relatively \u2018underaligned\u2019 locally, and only through normalization in smoothxg did we compress the bubble structures that are produced.

Next, variant sites were classified into small variant (<50\u2009bp) and SV (\u226550\u2009bp) sites. The SV sites were then annotated as described in the methods section of article that describes Minigraph34. In brief, the longest allele sequence of each SV site was extracted and stored in the FASTA format. The interspersed repeats, low-complexity regions, exact tandem repeats, centromeric satellites and gaps in the longest allele sequences were then identified using RepeatMasker (v.4.1.2-p1) with the NCBI/RMBLAST (v.2.10.0) search engine and Dfam (v.3.3) database, SDUST (v.0.1)101, ETRF (commit fc059d5)102, dna-brnn (v.0.1)90and seqtk gap (v.1.3)103, respectively.

To find hits to the GRCh38 reference genome, minimap2 (v.2.24) with options -cxasm20 -r2k --cs was used to align the longest allele sequences to the reference genome. Based on the identified features, SV sites were classified into various repeat classes using mgutils.js anno (https://github.com/lh3/minigraph/blob/master/misc/mgutils.js) with minor modifications to enable it to work with the files derived from the MC and PGGB graphs.",
            "We use the heaps tool of the odgi pangenome analysis toolkit98to estimate how the euchromatic autosomal pangenome grows with each additional genome assembly added. Here we approximated euchromatic regions by non-satellite DNA, which was identified by dna-brnn in the construction of the MC graph (see the \u2018MC\u2019\u00a0subsection). Although the MC non-reference haplotypes of the MC graph do not contain satellite DNA, the PGGB graph does. Consequently, we subset the PGGB graph to segments contained in the MC graph. We additionally excluded reference haplotypes (GRCh38 and CHM13) from the analysis. We then sampled permutations of the 88 non-reference (neither GRCh38 nor T2T-CHM13) haplotypes. In each permutation, we calculated the size of the pangenome after adding the first 1, 2, \u2026,Nhaplotypes in both graphs. This produced a collection of saturation curves from which we derived a median saturation curve onto which we fitted a power law function known as Heaps\u2019 Law. The exponent of this function is generally understood to represent the degree of openness\u2014or diversity\u2014of a pangenome39. Summing up, we called odgi heaps -i <graph.gfa> -S -n200 to generate pangenome saturation curves for 200 permutations. Next to calculating a non-permuted cumulative base count, we also counted the number of common (\u22655% of all non-reference haplotypes) and core (\u226595% of all non-reference haplotypes) bases in the pangenome graphs. To this end, we used a tool called panacus104and supplied a list of the samples in which they are grouped according to their assigned superpopulation (pangenome-growth -m -t bp <graph.gfa> <sample order>). We repeated the count, this time including only segments of depth \u22652, that is, contained at least twice in any haplotype sequence.",

To ease the comparison of variants with other call sets for each individual, the multi-sample VCF files were converted to per-sample VCF files using bcftools view -a -I -s <sample name>, and the multiallelic sites were split into biallelic records using bcftools norm -m -any. Owing to the limitations of snarl decomposition, snarls may contain multiple variants that cannot be further decomposed into nested snarls using vg deconstruct. If snarls of this kind are compared with truth calls, the evaluation will not be accurate.

In contrast to PBSV and Sniffles, SVIM outputs all calls no matter their quality. To determine the threshold used for filtering low-quality calls, a precision\u2013recall curve was generated across various quality scores by comparing with the GIAB (v.0.6) Tier 1 SV benchmark set for HG002 (Supplementary Fig.45).

DeepTrio then called small variants from the aligned reads. The same version and parameters were used for DeepTrio (v.1.3). Only the default model was used for these conditions. We also applied the native Dragen caller and joint genotyper to the Dragen-Graph-based alignments for comparison purposes, referred to as Dragen-DragenCall and Dragen-DragenJointCall, respectively. Dragen-DragenCall implements a single-sample based method and is what is the default use-case for processing Dragen-Graph-mapped data. Dragen-DragenJointCall uses a pedigree-backed implementation that informs which variants are likely to be de novo and which are erroneous given the genotype information of the parents. To make a fairer comparison with Dragen, we tested these configurations to assess what implementation of Dragen variant calling produced the best results given the available trio data.",
            "The small variant calls were evaluated using HG001\u2013HG007 with the GIAB benchmark (v.4.2.1)124, on HG002 in challenging medically relevant autosomal genes47, and on HG002 using a preliminary draft assembly-based benchmark. For the draft assembly-based benchmark, we used Dipcall38to align a scaffolded, high-coverage Trio-Hifiasm assembly21,38to GRCh38 and call variants, and then we excluded structurally variant regions from the dip.bed file as described above for the benchmarking of small variants from the pangenome graph. The comparison between the call sets and truth set was made with RTG\u2019s vcfeval83and Illumina\u2019s hap.py tool82on confident regions of the benchmark. We used high-coverage read sets of the GIAB HG001, HG002 and HG005 trio child samples and evaluated performance within the held-out chromosome\u200920 for the GIAB (v.4.2.1) truth set, or the entire genome for the reduced truth set of the challenging medically relevant autosomal genes. The evaluation was also stratified using the set of regions provided by the GIAB at GitHub (https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle/genome-stratifications)125.",
            "We applied our small variant calling pipeline to the high-coverage read sets for the 3,202 samples of the 1KG19. The output alignments, in the GAM format, and the VCFs were saved in public buckets athttps://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/brain-genomics-public/research/cohort/1KGP/vg/graph_to_grch38. We selected 100 trios among those samples to further evaluate the quality of the calls. We tested all variants that have at least one alternative allele in a trio for Mendelian consistency. In addition, for each variant, we only considered trios for which the child\u2019s genotype was different from the genotype of at least one of the parents to minimize bias created by systematic calls (for example, all homozygous or all heterozygous). We looked at the fraction of variants\u2013trios that failed Mendelian consistency in the entire genome and in sites that do not overlap simple repeats as defined by the \u2018simpleRepeat\u2019 track downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser. The results were compared with Mendelian consistency of calls provided by the 1KG that used GATK HaplotypeCaller on the reads aligned to GRCh38. We also repeated this analysis on the two trios of the GIAB (v.4.2.1) benchmark (HG002\u2013HG007) and across the different methods of our evaluation described above (BWA-MEM and DragenGraph mappers; DeepVariant, DeepTrio and Dragen variant callers).",
            "We used a VCF file created on the basis of snarl traversal of the MC graph as a basis for genotyping. The records contained in this VCF represent bubbles in the underlying pangenome graph and their nested variants, derived from the snarl tree. Each variant was marked according to their level in this tree. Variants annotated by \u2018LV=0\u2019 correspond to the top-level bubbles. We used vcfbub (v.0.1.0)100with parameters -l 0 and -r 100000 to filter the VCF. This removed all non-top-level bubbles from the VCF unless they were nested inside a top-level bubble with a reference length exceeding 100\u2009kb; that is, top-level bubbles longer than that are replaced by their child nodes in the snarl tree. The VCF also contained the haplotypes for all 44 assembly samples, representing paths in the pangenome graph. We additionally removed all records for which more than 20% of all 88 haplotypes carried a missing allele (\u201c.\u201d). This resulted in a set of 22,133,782 bubbles. In a next step, we used PanGenie (v.1.0.0)54to genotype these bubbles across all 3,202 samples from the 1KG based on high-coverage Illumina reads19.",
            "We genotyped all top-level bubbles across all 1KG samples. Whereas biallelic bubbles can be easily classified representing SNPs, indels or SVs, this becomes more difficult for multiallelic bubbles contained in the VCF. In particular, larger multiallelic bubbles can contain a high number of nested variant alleles overlapping across haplotypes, represented as a single bubble in the graph. This is especially problematic when comparing the genotypes computed for the entire bubble to external call sets, as coordinates of the bubble do not necessarily represent the exact coordinates of individual variant alleles carried by a sample in such a region (Supplementary Fig.20).",
            "To tackle this problem, we implemented a decomposition approach that aimed to detect all variant alleles nested inside multiallelic top-level records. The idea was to detect variants from the node traversals of the reference and alternative alleles of all top-level bubbles. Given the node traversals of a reference and alternative path through a bubble, our approach was to match each reference node to its leftmost occurrence in the alternative traversal, resulting in an alignment of the node traversals (Supplementary Fig.21a). Nested alleles could then be determined based on indels and mismatches in this alignment. As the node traversals of the alternative alleles can visit the same node more than once (which is not the case for the reference alleles of the MC graph), this approach is not guaranteed to reconstruct the optimal sequence alignment underlying the nodes in these repeated regions.",
            "As an output, the decomposition process generated two VCF files. The first one is a multiallelic VCF that contains exactly the same variant records as the input VCF, just that annotations for all alternative alleles of a record were added to the identifier tag in the INFO field. For each alternative allele, the identifier tag contains identifiers encoding all nested variants it is composed of, separated by a colon. The second VCF is biallelic and contains a separate record for each nested variant identifier defining reference and alternative allele of the respective variant (Supplementary Fig.21b). Both VCFs are different representations of the same genomic variation, that is, before and after decomposition. We applied this decomposition method to the MC-based VCF file, used the multiallelic output VCF as input for PanGenie to genotype bubbles, and used the biallelic VCF as well as the identifiers to translate PanGenie\u2019s genotypes for bubbles to genotypes for all individual nested variant alleles. All downstream analyses of the genotypes are based on this biallelic representation (that is, after decomposition).",
            "Although the majority of short bubbles (<10\u2009bp) are biallelic, particularly large bubbles (>1,000\u2009bp) tend to be multiallelic. Sometimes each of the 88 non-reference (neither GRCh38 nor T2T-CHM13) haplotypes contained in the graph covered a different path through such a bubble (Supplementary Fig.22a), leading to a VCF record with 88 alternative alleles listed. We determined the number of variant alleles located inside biallelic and multiallelic bubbles in the pangenome after decomposition. As expected, the majority of SV alleles was located inside of the more complex, multiallelic regions of the pangenome (Supplementary Fig.22b).",
            "We conducted a leave-one-out experiment to evaluate PanGenie\u2019s genotyping performance for the call set samples. For this purpose, we repeatedly removed one of the panel samples from the MC VCF and genotyped it using only the remaining samples as an input panel for PanGenie. We later used the genotypes of the left-out sample as ground truth for evaluation. We repeated this experiment for five of the call set samples (HG00438, HG00733, HG02717, NA20129 and HG03453) using 1KG high-coverage Illumina reads19. PanGenie is a re-genotyping method. Therefore, like every other re-typer, it can only genotype variants contained in the input panel VCF, that is, it is not able to detect variants unique to the genotyped sample. For this reason, we removed all variant alleles (after decomposition) unique to the left-out sample contained in the truth set for evaluation. To evaluate the genotype performance, we used the weighted genotype concordance54. Extended Data Fig.9shows the results stratified by different regions. Extended Data Fig.9ashows concordances in biallelic and multiallelic regions of the MC VCF. The biallelic regions include only bubbles with two branches. The multiallelic regions include all bubbles in which haplotypes cover more than two different paths. Extended Data Fig.9bshows the same results stratified by genomic regions defined by GIAB that we obtained from the following genotypes: easy (https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.0/GRCh38/union/GRCh38_notinalldifficultregions.bed.gz); low-mappability (https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.0/GRCh38/union/GRCh38_alllowmapandsegdupregions.bed.gz); repeats (https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.0/GRCh38/LowComplexity/GRCh38_AllTandemRepeats_gt100bp_slop5.bed.gz); and other-difficult (https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.0/GRCh38/OtherDifficult/GRCh38_allOtherDifficultregions.bed.gz).",
            "Here and in the following, we considered results for SNPs, indels (1\u201349\u2009bp), SV deletions, SV insertions and other SV alleles, defined as follows: SV deletions include all alleles for which length(REF)\u2009\u226550\u2009bp and length(ALT)\u2009=\u20091\u2009bp; SV insertions include all alleles for which length(REF)\u2009=\u20091\u2009bp and length(ALT)\u2009\u2265\u200950\u2009bp; all other alleles with a length \u226550\u2009bp are included in \u2018others\u2019.",
            "Overall, weighted genotype concordances were high for all variant types. In particular, variant alleles in biallelic regions of the graph were easily genotypable. Alleles inside multiallelic bubbles were more difficult to genotype correctly as PanGenie needs to decide between several possible alternative paths, whereas there are only two such paths for biallelic regions (Extended Data Fig.9a). Furthermore, genotyping accuracy depended on the genomic context (Extended Data Fig.9b). Regions with low mappability, repetitive regions and other difficult regions were harder to genotype than regions classified as \u2018easy\u2019 by GIAB.",
            "We generated genotypes for all 3,202 1KG samples with PanGenie and defined a high-quality subset of SV alleles that we could reliably genotype. For this purpose, we applied a machine-learning approach similar to what we have previously presented5,54. We defined positive and negative subsets of variants based on the following filters: ac0_fail, a variant allele was genotyped with an AF of 0.0 across all samples; mendel_fail, the mendelian consistency across trios is <80% for a variant allele. Here, we use a strict definition of Mendelian consistency, which excludes all trios with only 0/0, only 0/1 and only 1/1 genotypes; gq_fail, <50 high-quality genotypes were reported for this variant allele; self_fail, genotyping accuracy of a variant allele across the panel samples is <90%; nonref_fail, not a single non-0/0 genotype was genotyped correctly across all panel samples.",
            "The positive set included all variant alleles that passed all five filters. The negative set contained all variant alleles that passed the ac0_fail filter but failed at least three of the other filters. We trained a support vector regression approach based on these two sets that used multiple features, including AFs, Mendelian consistencies or the number of alternative alleles transmitted from parents to children. We applied this method to all remaining variant alleles genotyped with an AF\u2009>\u20090, resulting in a score between \u20131 (bad) and 1 (good) for each. We finally defined a filtered set of variants that included the positive set and all variant alleles with a score of \u2265\u2009\u20130.5.",
            "We show the number of variant alleles contained in the unfiltered set, the positive set and the filtered set in Supplementary Table18. As our focus is on SVs and as 65% of all SNPs and indels are already contained in the positive set, we applied our machine-learning approach only to SVs. We found that 50%, 33% and 26% of all deletion, insertion and other alleles, respectively, were contained in the final, filtered set of variants. Note that these numbers take all distinct SV alleles contained in the call sets into account. Especially for insertions and other SVs, many of these alleles are highly similar, with sometimes only a single base pair differing. Therefore, it is probable that many of these actually represent the same events. Our genotyping and filtering approach helped to remove such redundant alleles.",
            "To evaluate the quality of the PanGenie genotypes, we compared the AFs observed for the SV alleles across all 2,504 unrelated 1KG samples to their AFs observed across the 44 assembly samples in the MC call set. Supplementary Figs.23\u201325show the results for SV deletions, insertions and other SV alleles. We observed that the AFs between both sets matched well, resulting in Pearson correlations of 0.93, 0.87 and 0.81 for deletions, insertions and other alleles, respectively, contained in the unfiltered set. For the filtered set, we observed correlations of 0.96, 0.93 and 0.90, respectively. We also analysed the heterozygosity of the PanGenie genotypes across all 2,504 unrelated 1KG samples and observed a relationship close to what is expected by Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (Supplementary Figs.23\u201325, lower panels).",
            "We compared our filtered set of variant alleles to the HGSVC PanGenie genotypes (v.2.0 lenient set)5and Illumina-based SV genotypes19. A direct comparison of the three call sets is difficult. The HGSVC and HPRC call sets are based on variant calls produced from haplotype-resolved assemblies of 32 and 44 samples, respectively5. For each call set, variants were re-genotyped across all 3,202 1KG samples. Note that the call set samples for HPRC and HGSVC are disjoint. As re-genotyping cannot discover new variants, both call sets will miss variants carried by 3,202 samples that were not seen in the assembly samples. By contrast, the 1KG call set contains short-read based variant calls produced for each of the 3,202 1KG samples. Another difference between the HGSVC and HPRC call sets is that in the HGSVC call set, highly similar alleles are merged into a single record to correct for representation differences across different samples or haplotypes. The HPRC call set, however, keeps all these alleles separately even if there is only a single base pair difference between them. To make the call sets better comparable, we merged clusters of highly similar alleles in the HPRC filtered set before comparisons with other call sets. This was done with Truvari (v.3.1.0)112using the command: truvari collapse -r 500 -p 0.95 -P 0.95 -s 50 -S 100000.",
            "To be able to properly compare the call sets despite their differences, we counted the number of SV alleles present in each sample (genotype 0/1 or 1/1) in each call set and plotted the corresponding distributions stratified by genome annotations from GIAB (same as above, Fig.6d). We also generated the same plot including only common SV alleles with an AF\u2009>\u20095% across all 3,202 samples (Supplementary Fig.28). Both plots showed that both assembly based call sets (HPRC and HGSVC) were able to access more SVs across the genome than the short-read-based 1KG call set, especially deletions <300\u2009bp and insertions (Fig.6e). This result confirms that SV callers based on short reads alone miss a large proportion of SVs located in regions inaccessible by short-read alignments, which has been previously reposed by several studies5,8. In the \u2018easy\u2019 regions, the number of SVs per sample was consistent across all three call sets. For the other regions, however, results indicated that the HPRC-filtered genotypes provided access to more variant alleles than the HGSVC lenient set, especially insertions and variants in regions of low mappability and tandem repeats (Fig.6d,e).",
            "To evaluate the new SVs in our filtered HPRC call set, we revisited the leave-one-out experiment we had previously performed on the unfiltered set of variants (see above). We restricted the evaluation to the following subset of variants: (1) those that are in our filtered set but not in the 1KG Illumina calls (novel); (2) those in our filtered set and in the 1KG Illumina call set (known); and (3) all variants in our filtered set. To find matches between our set and the Illumina calls, we used a criterion based on reciprocal overlap of at least 50%. Results are shown in Supplementary Fig.29. We generated two versions of this figure: the first one (top) excludes variants that are unique to the left-out sample and therefore not typable by any re-genotyping method, and the second one includes these variants (bottom). In general, genotype concordances of all lenient variants (brown, dark purple) were slightly higher compared with the concordances we observed for the unfiltered set (Supplementary Fig.29). Furthermore, concordances of the known variants were highest. This is expected, as these variants tended to be in regions easier to access by short reads. Concordances for novel variants were slightly worse. This was also expected, as these variants tended to be located in more complex genomic regions that are generally harder to access. However, even for these variants, concordances were still high, which indicated that the PanGenie genotypes for these variants are of high quality.",
            "In addition to all 3,202 1KG samples, we genotyped sample HG002 based on Illumina reads from ref.18. We used the GIAB CMRG benchmark containing medically relevant SVs47downloaded fromhttps://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/CMRG_v1.00/GRCh38/StructuralVariant/for evaluation. Similar to the 1KG samples, we used the MC-based VCF (see above) containing variant bubbles and haplotypes of 44 assembly samples as an input panel for PanGenie. We extracted all variant alleles with a length \u226550\u2009bp from our genotyped VCF (biallelic version, after decomposition). We converted the ground truth VCF into a biallelic representation using bcftools norm -m -any and kept all alleles with length \u226550\u2009bp. We used Truvari (v.3.1.0)112with parameters --multimatch --includebed <medically-relevant-sv-bed> -r 2000 --no-ref a -C 2000 --passonly to compare our genotype predictions to the medically relevant SVs. Results are shown in Supplementary Table22. As PanGenie is a re-typing method, it can only genotype variants provided in the input and therefore cannot detect novel alleles. As HG002 is not among the panel samples, the input VCF misses variants unique to this HG002 sample. Thus, these unique variants cannot be genotyped by PanGenie and will be counted as false negatives during evaluation. Therefore, we computed an adjusted version of the recall that excluded SV alleles unique to HG002 (that is, alleles not in the graph) from the truth set for evaluation. To identify which SV alleles were unique, we compared each of the 44 panel samples to the ground truth VCF using Truvari to identify the false negatives for each sample. Then we computed the intersection of false-negative calls across all samples. The resulting set then contained all variant alleles unique to the HG002 ground truth set. We found 15 such unique SV alleles among the GIAB CMRG variants. We removed these alleles from the ground truth set and recomputed precision\u2013recall statistics for our genotypes. Adjusted precision\u2013recall values are shown in Supplementary Table22.",

The transcript sequences used for the simulation were derived from the GENCODE (v.38) transcript annotations projected onto assembled haplotypes from HG002. Specifically, we used MC to create an alignment between GRCh38 and the two HPRC HG002 assembly haplotypes, which were held out of the main pangenome graph for benchmarking. We then used CAT to lift the transcript annotations over to these haplotypes. We constructed a spliced personal genome graph using the vg rna subcommand, and then we simulated reads using vg sim (commit 2cea1e2) using an Illumina NovaSeq cDNA read set (SRR18109271) to fit model parameters. This essentially amounts to simulating directly from the projected transcript sequences. The transcripts were simulated with uniform expression, split evenly between the two haplotypes, keeping the reads from each haplotype separate. This expression profile is not biologically realistic, but it avoids the difficulty of choosing a particular expression profile as representative for all tissues and stages of development. Moreover, existing estimated profiles would be biased towards the tools that were used to estimate them. We simulated 5,000,000 paired-end 150\u2009bp RNA-seq reads.",

For the long-read data, we used PacBio Iso-Seq alignments from the ENCODE project (ENCSR706ANY, all replicates), which come from the same cell line as the Illumina data. The long-read alignments were used to define the exons, and only primary long-read alignments with a mapping quality of at least 30 were used. The alignments for the four Iso-Seq replicates (ENCFF247TLH,ENCFF431IOE,ENCFF520MMCandENCFF626GWM) were combined and filtered using SAMtools (v.1.15)130. BEDTools (v.2.30.0) was used to convert the alignments to exons coordinates123.",
            "We also used the results of the mapping experiment to quantify allelic bias. We used vg deconstruct to identify sites of variation in the MC graph of haplotypes from HG002, with deletions greater than 10\u2009kb removed to avoid spurious variants. Variants overlapping exons were selected and normalized using BCFtools (v.1.16)130. Next we counted the number of mapped reads from each of the two haplotypes that overlapped each heterozygous exonic variant57. Specifically, the read count for each allele was calculated as the average count across the two breakpoints of an allele. This was done to treat different variant types and lengths equally. We then tested all variants with a read coverage of at least 20 for allelic bias using a two-sided binomial test at\u03b1=\u20090.01. All tests that reject the null hypothesis are false positives, as the reads were simulated without allelic bias. The results were split into different classes of variants and plotted against the number of sites that achieved a coverage of at least 20, which is a rough indicator of mapping sensitivity. Indels larger than 50\u2009bp were excluded.",
            "We also compared gene expression inference using the mapped reads. For the vg mpmap (v.1.43.0) graph mappings, we used RPVG (commit 1d91a9e)57in transcript inference mode to quantify expression. Two different transcript annotations were used as input to RPVG. The MC pantranscriptome was created from the CAT transcript annotations on each assembly and the GENCODE (v.38) transcriptome. The mpmap-RPVG pipeline was compared with Salmon (v.1.9.0)131and RSEM (v.1.3.3)132. These methods were provided the GENCODE (v.38) transcriptome as input, both with and without transcripts on the GRCh38 alternative contigs. Any genes unique to the alternative contigs were filtered. For Salmon, the GRCh38 reference was used as a decoy and duplicate transcripts were kept. Bowtie2 (v.2.4.5)133was used as a mapper for RSEM. Gene expression values were calculated by summing the corresponding transcript level values for each gene. GffRead (v.0.12.7) was used to create a table of gene names and transcript identifiers from the transcript annotation134. The accuracy was measured in two ways: (1) the Spearman correlation between the simulated and inferred expression values, and (2) the mean absolute relative difference between the simulated and inferred expression values.",
            "The scripts that were used for graph construction, read simulation, mapping and evaluation are available at GitHub (https://github.com/jonassibbesen/hprc-rnaseq-analyses-scripts).",
            "We aligned H3K4me1, H3K27ac and ATAC-seq obtained from monocyte-derived macrophages from 30 individuals59using vg map13to the GRCh38 reference genome graph and to the HPRC genome graph. Then we called peaks using Graph Peak Caller (v.1.2.3)135on both sets of alignments for each of the 30 H3K4me1, H3K27ac and ATAC-seq samples. To identify HPRC-only peaks, we projected HPRC coordinates to the GRCh38 path using Graph Peak Caller and compared intervals using BEDTools123. We named HPRC peaks that overlapped GRCh38 peaks as common peaks and those that do not as HPRC-only. We calculated the expected frequency (as inverse cumulative distributions) of common and HPRC-only peaks among the 30 samples by resampling the peaks of each sample from the peaks of all the samples and re-counted the number of overlaps. We repeated this simulation 100 times and plotted the average curves. We determined heterozygous variants in our samples by aligning WGS datasets for each sample to the HPRC graph using vg map and genotyping the variants using vg call -a. We narrowed the list of heterozygous SVs above 50\u2009bp in each sample with the aim of looking for allelic-specific peaks. For each epigenomic sample, we obtained allelic-specific read counts within peaks that lie on the previously identified loci by running vg call -a on the epigenomic HPRC alignments, which outputs the numbers of reads on each path in a bubble (DP and AD fields in the VCF output). We then assigned peaks to the SV or reference allele, or both alleles with a two-tailed binomial test parameterized on the sum of reads on both alleles andP=\u20090.05. Any peak with reads on one allele, but not on the other was assigned to the allele with the reads. Read counts were proportionally adjusted for the difference in length between the reference and SV alleles.",
            "Processed data, scripts and code for the above steps are available at Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.6564396).",
            "Although the size of the population sample represented in our pangenome is small, it provides access to previously under-ascertained regions of the genome. We sought to understand the potential utility of these regions for future population genetic studies using regional PCA based on variants called compared to the CHM13 and GRCh38 references. For these analyses, we considered both the PGGB (whole pangenome, combined) and MC (reference-based, distinct CHM13 and GRCh38) graphs. For both graph models, the CHM13 VCFs provide access to regions that were not previously observed by studies based on GRCh38, for which short-read-based studies may have difficulty reliably aligning and calling variants. In combination, these two graphs provide cross-validation of implied population genetic patterns in these new regions, which we explore here.",
            "To understand chromosome-specific patterns of variation, we applied PCA to each autosomal chromosome independently to the VCFs from PGGB (PGGB-CHM13, PGGB-GRCh38).",
            "To ensure that observed patterns were not derived from higher rates of assembly error in the repetitive regions of acrocentric p-arms, we used our Flagger-confident region annotations to prune the PGGB graph (using odgi inject to inject the confident regions as subpaths and then odgi prune to remove the full original paths that were including unreliable regions) to only confident regions of assemblies. We then reapplied vg deconstruct to this graph to obtain a new set of SNPs (the code for the PGGB graphs pruning and variant calling on the pruned graphs can be found at the following link:https://github.com/pangenome/HPRCyear1v2genbank/blob/main/workflows/confident_variants.md). Genome-wide, we found that pruning reduced the number of called SNPs by only 1.188% (previousN=\u200923,272,652, prunedN=\u200922,996,113). The total reduction in the acrocentrics was higher, with 6.29% fewer SNPs (previousN=\u20093,735,605, prunedN=\u20093,676,746), which indicated the difficulty in assembling these regions. We note that the PCA sample distributions remained almost identical (data not shown), which indicated that the patterns observed in the full graph are maintained despite assembly issues. In these filtered PGGB-CHM13 and PGGB-GRCh38 VCFs, we considered all biallelic SNPs relative to the chosen reference, regardless of variant nesting level (data not shown; filtering for only SNPs LV\u2009=\u20090 or LV\u2009>\u20090 produced nearly identical results). A qualitative evaluation suggested no significant differences in PCA patterns across the metacentric chromosomes (Supplementary Fig.47). However, in the p-arms of the acrocentrics (chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22), which are accessible in the PGGB-CHM13 VCF, we observed a reduction in population differentiation and a higher rate of variance explained in the lowest principal component.",
            "To investigate this quantitatively, we measured the number of clusters implied by the PCA for the PGGB-CHM13 VCFs usingk-means clustering to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters for each PCA (gap_stat clustering in the fviz_nbclust function of the factoextra R package) (analysis code available at:https://github.com/SilviaBuonaiuto/hprcPopGenAnalysis). Applying this approach to three PCAs per chromosome VCF, we obtained optimal cluster counts for the p-arm, q-arm and entire chromosome. In metacentric chromosomes, we usually observed optimal numbers of clusters approximately corresponding to the number of expected world population groupings in the input genomes (3\u20135, as in Supplementary Fig.48). However, in the p-arms of the acrocentrics, we observed much fewer, in general only one cluster, indicative of reduced population differentiation compared with other parts of the acrocentric chromosomes. This pattern was only apparent in the PGGB graph based on CHM13. To evaluate the difference quantitatively, we applied a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the differences between cluster count distributions in metacentric versus acrocentric chromosomes across the entire chromosome, the q-arm and the p-arm. There were non-significant differences between the distributions between acrocentric and metacentric chromosomes at a chromosome scale and in the q-arms, but a significant difference (WilcoxonP=\u20090.013) in the case of acrocentric p-arms (Supplementary Fig.49).",
            "This analysis indicates that significant challenges remain for the use of these new regions in population genetic studies. Patterns observed in PCA projections of the pangenome across all chromosomes suggests a distinct process of variation sharing between populations within the short arms of the acrocentrics. In effect, we observed a more homogenous population in these regions when using the CHM13 assembly as a reference. This reference contains real sequences in these regions, whereas GRCh38 contains gaps, which render analysis impossible. The apparent population homogenization could be driven by error. We mitigated this issue by utilizing only SNPs found in Flagger-confident regions, but this does not guard against potential sources of alignment error that are likely to be amplified by the repetitive sequences in these loci. It is also possible that the chromosome-specific partitioning process applied by both graph models is failing to correctly partition contigs on these short arms. The known homology between the short arms bolsters the possibility of ongoing sequence information exchange between non-homologous chromosomes3, which would be consistent with the patterns we observed. In summary, this analysis shows that when using CHM13 as a reference, the behaviour of sequences on the short arms of the acrocentrics in the PGGB graph is not similar to that of other sequences in the pangenome.",

            "Comparisons of maternally-inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and paternally-inherited non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY) variation have provided important insights into the impact of sex-biased processes (such as migration, residence pattern, and so on) on human genetic variation. However, such comparisons have been limited by the different molecular methods typically used to assay mtDNA and NRY variation (for example, sequencing hypervariable segments of the control region for mtDNAvs.genotyping SNPs and/or STR loci for the NRY). Here, we report a simple capture array method to enrich Illumina sequencing libraries for approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence, which we use to generate NRY sequences from 623 males from 51 populations in the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP). We also obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences from the same individuals, allowing us to compare maternal and paternal histories free of any ascertainment bias.",
            "We identified 2,228 SNPs in the NRY sequences and 2,163 SNPs in the mtDNA sequences. Our results confirm the controversial assertion that genetic differences between human populations on a global scale are bigger for the NRY than for mtDNA, although the differences are not as large as previously suggested. More importantly, we find substantial regional variation in patterns of mtDNAversusNRY variation. Model-based simulations indicate very small ancestral effective population sizes (<100) for the out-of-Africa migration as well as for many human populations. We also find that the ratio of female effective population size to male effective population size (Nf/Nm) has been greater than one throughout the history of modern humans, and has recently increased due to faster growth in Nfthan Nm.",

            "Comparisons of mtDNA and NRY variation have provided numerous important insights into the maternal and paternal histories of human populations [1-3]. However, such comparisons are limited by methodological differences in how mtDNA and NRY variation have been typically assayed. MtDNA variation is usually investigated by sequencing hypervariable segments of the control region, (or, increasingly, via complete mtDNA genome sequences), while human NRY variation is routinely assayed by genotyping SNPs of interest, often in combination with short tandem repeat (STR) loci. Nevertheless, NRY SNP typing has several drawbacks due to the ascertainment bias inherent in the selection of SNPs [1,4,5]. This ascertainment bias complicates many analyses of interest, such as dating the age of the NRY ancestor or particular divergence events in the NRY phylogeny, as well as demographic inferences such as population size changes [4]. Moreover, the difference in molecular methods used to assay NRYversusmtDNA variation can complicate the interpretation of differences between patterns of NRY and mtDNA variation. For example, the seminal finding that NRY differences are bigger than mtDNA differences among global populations of humans, and that this is due to a higher rate of female than male migration due to patrilocality [6], may instead reflect methodological differences in how mtDNAversusNRY variation was assayed in that study [7].",
            "Another fundamental question concerns whether or not male and female effective population sizes have been the same over time. Attempts to address this question using the ratio of X chromosome to autosomal DNA diversity have come up with conflicting answers [8,9], which may in part reflect the use of different methods that capture information about effective population size at different times in the past [10]. Moreover, the ratio of X to autosome diversity varies along the X chromosome, depending how far polymorphic sites are from genes [11-13], indicating a potential role for selection in distorting effective population size estimates from comparisons of X chromosome to autosomal DNA diversity. These and other fundamental aspects of human maternal and paternal demographic history remain unanswered.",
            "Recently, analyses have been carried out of NRY sequences obtained as part of whole genome sequencing projects [14-16]. While these studies provide very detailed insights into the NRY phylogeny, they are nonetheless limited by the expense of whole genome sequencing, which precludes comprehensive global sampling. To allow for more accurate comparisons between mtDNA and NRY variation and to permit demographic inferences based on the NRY, we developed a capture-based array to enrich Illumina sequencing libraries for approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence. We used this approach to obtain NRY sequences from 623 males from 51 globally-distributed populations, and we also obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences from the same individuals, allowing us to investigate and directly compare the paternal and maternal relationships of global human populations in unprecedented detail.",
            "The samples consist of 623 males (Additional file1: Table S1) from the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) [17]. The samples were taken from the subset \u2018H952\u2019, which excludes atypical, duplicated, and closely-related samples [18]. Approximately 200\u00a0ng of genomic DNA from each sample was sheared by sonication using a Bioruptor system (Diogenode) and used to construct an Illumina Sequencing library with a specific double-index as described previously [19]. The libraries were then enriched separately for NRY and mtDNA sequences as described below.",
            "We targeted unique regions on the NRY that are free of repeats and to which the typically short next-generation sequencing reads could be mapped with high confidence. We used the UCSC table browser [20] and the February 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) assembly and applied the following filter criteria. First, from the group \u2018variation and repeats\u2019, sequence regions annotated in the following tracks were removed: Interrupted Repeats, RepeatMasker, Simple Repeats, and Segmental Duplications. Next, we used the \u2018mapability\u2019 table \u2018CRG Align 75\u2019 from the group \u2018mapping and sequencing tracks\u2019 to identify and remove regions with mapability scores below 1. We then removed regions of less than 500\u00a0bp in order to reduce the number of fragments and thereby the number of fragment ends, which have low probe densities. We also removed 15mers that occurred more than 100 times in the hg19 genome assembly, as described previously [21], which resulted in splitting some target regions into sub-regions that were less than 500\u00a0bp. The final result was a total of approximately 500\u00a0kb of unique NRY sequence, distributed among 655 target regions ranging from 61\u00a0bp to 3.9\u00a0kb (Additional file2: Table S2). These regions were then used to design a custom array (SureSelect 1\u00a0M capture array, Agilent) with 60\u00a0nt probes that were printed twice with a tiling density of 1\u00a0bp.",
            "Up to 60 barcoded libraries were pooled in equimolar ratio. The library mix was enriched for target NRY regions by hybridization-capture on the custom designed array following the protocol described previously [22]. After enrichment the library-pool was quantified by qPCR and then amplified to a total of approximately 1012molecules. The final concentration and length distribution was measured on an Agilent DNA 100 microchip, and 10\u00a0nmol of the amplified library pool was used for sequencing. Each pool, consisting of 48 to 60 samples, was sequenced on a Solexa GAII lane using a paired end 75\u00a0cycle run plus two 7\u00a0nt index reads.",
            "Up to 94 libraries were pooled in equimolar ratio and the library pool was enriched for mtDNA sequences by an in-solution hybridization capture method [23]. The hybridization eluate was measured by qPCR and then amplified to produce a final concentration of 10\u00a0nmol. Up to 200 samples were sequenced on a Solexa GAII lane using a paired end 75\u00a0cycle run, plus two 7\u00a0nt index reads.",
            "In each Solexa GAII lane, 1% PhiX174 phage DNA was spiked in and used as a training set to estimate base quality scores with the IBIS base-caller [24]. Reads with more than five bases having a PHRED scaled quality score below Q15 were discarded, as were reads having a single base quality in the index read (7\u00a0nt) score below Q10. Reads with no mismatches to the expected double index sequences were assigned to each individual sample library.",
            "For the NRY-enriched data, reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37) using default settings with BWA v0.5.10 [25]. We mapped to the whole genome rather than just the target region, in order to identify reads that might, with equal probability, map to another position in the genome. The bam files containing the mapping information and reads were processed with samtools v0.1.18 [26]. We used Picard 1.42 to mark duplicates, based on the start and end coordinates of the read pairs. The final SNP call was done on all samples simultaneously using the UnifiedGenotyper from the GATK v2.0-35 package [27] and the following options: --output_mode EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES, --genotype_likelihoods_model SNP, --min_base_quality_score 20 and --heterozygosity 0.0000000001. The result was stored in a VCF file containing information for each callable site of the target region, and a second VCF file was created that contained only the variable positions among the 623 samples. For each sample at each variable position the PL scores were calculated with samtools [26]; PL scores are normalized, PHRED-scaled likelihoods for the three genotypes (0/0, 0/1, 1/1) and are based on, among other things, coverage, base quality, and mapping quality. Positions that showed a difference in the PL score of less than 30 between homozygote reference (0/0) and homozygote alternative (1/1) were called an \u2018N\u2019 in that sample, as were positions where heterozygote calls (0/1) either had a higher PL score than the most likely homozygous genotype, or differed by less than 30 from the most likely homozygous genotype. Note that a PL score of 30 between genotype 0/0 and 1/1 means that the former is 1,000 times more likely than the latter, for example, the genotype-calling error rate is expected to be less than 1 in 1,000. Sites where more than two bases were called (that is, multi-allelic sites) were also removed.",
            "For the mtDNA-enriched data, reads were mapped to the revised mtDNA reference sequence (GenBank number:NC_012920) using the software MIA [28]. The consensus sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 [29] (cmd line: muscle -maxiters 1 -diags mt_623seq.fasta mt_623seq.aln), and haplogroups were called with the HaploGrep software [30].",
            "After quality filtering, there were 2,276 variable sites in the NRY sequences, with a total of 2.54% of the individual genotypes at variable positions scored as \u2018N\u2019 (that is, as missing data; the number of missing sites per individual ranged from 9 to 1,173, with an average of 122 missing sites per individual). Since missing data can influence the results of some analyses, we took advantage of the fact that the NRY target regions are completely linked with no recombination to impute missing data as follows. First, all sites with no missing data (605 sites) were used as the reference set to define haplotypes and calculate the number of differences between each haplotype. Sites with missing data were then imputed, beginning with the site with the smallest amount of missing data and proceeding sequentially. For each haplotype with missing data for that site, the missing base was imputed as the allele present in the reference haplotype that had the fewest differences (based on the sites with no missing data). After imputation was finished for that site, it was added to the reference set, and the procedure continued for the next site with the smallest amount of missing data.",
            "As a check on the accuracy of the imputation, we randomly deleted 2.54% of the known alleles, following the distribution of missing alleles in the full dataset, thereby creating an artificial dataset with a similar distribution of missing alleles as in the observed dataset. We then imputed the missing data according to the above procedure and compared the imputed alleles to the true alleles; this procedure was carried out 1,000 times. The imputed allele matched the true allele in 99.1% of the comparisons, indicating that the imputation procedure is quite accurate.",
            "We expect the majority of the NRY SNPs to have mutated only once, as recurrent mutations in the known NRY phylogeny are quite rare [31,32]. Therefore, as a further quality control measure, we investigated the NRY data for recurrent mutations by constructing a maximum parsimony tree for the 2,276 SNPs using programs in PHYLIP. We then estimated the number of mutations at each SNP, and removed 48 SNPs that had mutated more than twice, and only in terminal branches, as these are likely to reflect sequencing errors. The final dataset contains 2,228 SNPs.",
            "Basic summary statistics (haplotype diversity, mean number of pairwise differences, nucleotide diversity, Tajima\u2019s D value and theta(S)) were calculated using Arlequin v3.5.1.3 [33]. Arlequin was further used to estimate pairwise \u03a6STvalues and for Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA). The observed ratio of the mean pairwise differences (mpd) for the NRYversusmtDNA was calculated as mpdNRY/mpdmt. In order to detect group-specific deviations from the mean distribution of the mpd ratio in the dataset, we carried out a resampling approach. For each group sample size (Ngroup) we chose randomly Ngroupindividuals (out of 623) and calculated the mpd ratio using the dist.dna command from the APE package [34] in R. This was repeated 10,000 times for each Ngroupsample size to obtain the distribution of resampled mpd ratios.",
            "Divergence times in the NRY and mtDNA phylogenies were estimated using a Bayesian approach implemented in BEAST v1.6.2 [35]. For the mtDNA genome sequences we divided the alignment into two partitions consisting of the coding and non-coding regions, respectively. For both partitions we estimated the best fitting substitution model using jModeltest [36] and the mutation rates estimated previously [37]. These rates were calibrated by a combination of chimpanzee-human divergence and archaeological colonization dates, take into account time-dependency in the molecular clock, and are in the range of recent estimates of the mtDNA mutation rate [15,38,39]. For the non-coding region we used the GTR\u2009+\u2009I\u2009+\u2009G substitution model and a mutation rate of 9.883\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128substitutions/site/year, while for the coding region we used the TrN\u2009+\u2009I\u2009+\u2009G model and a mutation rate of 1.708\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128substitutions/site/year. A strict clock and a constant size coalescence model were used, and the MCMC was run for 10 million steps with sampling from the posterior every 2,000 steps. The MCMC was run on five independent chains in parallel. After careful inspection of the log files in Tracer, the tree files of the five runs were merged after discarding the first 2,500 trees (50%) of each run as burn-in. A consensus tree was built from the merged trees using TreeAnnotator, and the consensus tree showing the divergence times for each node was visualized with FigTree.",
            "For the NRY sequences the same procedure was used, but modified as only variable sites were included in the BEAST analysis in order to reduce the computational time. The substitution model used was HKY without I\u2009+\u2009G, and the substitution rate was multiplied by the number of callable sites (501,108 sites) divided by the number of variable sites (2,228 sites). As there is uncertainty regarding the mutation rate, we ran the analysis twice, with a \u2018fast\u2019 rate [40] of 1.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129substitutions/site/year (transformed to 2.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127) and with a \u2018slow\u2019 rate [41] of 6.17\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210substitutions/site/year (transformed to 1.39\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127).",
            "Bayesian skyline plots [42] were used to estimate population size change through time, using the same mutation rates and substitution models described above. The piecewise-linear Skyline coalescence model was chosen and the number of groups (bins) was set to half the sample size per group with a maximum of 20. A single MCMC chain was ran for 30 million steps and sampled every 3,000 steps from the posterior. The log file was inspected in Tracer for convergence of the chain and ESS values and the Bayesian Skyline Reconstruction was run.",
            "We used a simulation-based approach to estimate current and ancestral effective population sizes, based on either mtDNA or NRY sequences, for each regional grouping of populations. We started with the model of population history shown in Figure1, which consists of six geographic regions, and corresponds to a tree built from genome-wide SNP data from the HGDP populations [43], with the exception that Oceania branches off first among non-African populations in Figure1rather than directly from East Asia. This alternative placement of Oceania is in keeping with subsequent studies of genome-wide data that have tested various models and found strongest support for an early branching of Oceanian population [44-46]. The model includes 44 populations and 511 individuals; we excluded the Adygei, Uygur, Hazara, and all of the ME/NA populations as these exhibit high levels of admixture between the regional groups in genome-wide analyses [43,47]. We first simulated the combined mtDNA and NRY sequences with the fastsimcoal software [48] and used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) [49] to estimate divergence times based on the combined dataset, with the same mtDNA mutation rate used in the BEAST analysis and an average of the fast and slow NRY mutation rates. We simulated 5,808,805 observations, which were log transformed via ABC linear regression [49] using the following statistics: polymorphic sites (S), pairwise differences (Pi), Tajima\u2019s D, pairwise \u03a6st, and the variance components for an AMOVA based on two groups, Africaversusnon-Africa (the latter consisting of the pooled data from the five non-African regional groups). We then used this history (Figure1) and the mean divergence times based on the combined data in a further set of simulations to estimate from the mtDNA and NRY sequences the ancestral and current effective population sizes, for females and males, respectively, for each regional group of populations. We simulated 5,116,984 observations for the mtDNA sequences and 5,325,179 observations for the NRY sequences, and retained the top 1,000 simulations (tolerance of 0.03%) in each case for parameter estimation.",
            "",
            "The model of population history used in simulations.We assumed a single out-of-Africa migration and further population divergence events (see text for further details). The model begins with the ancestral population in Africa (at time T1), a single out-of-Africa migration (T2), the first split between Oceania and Eurasia (T3), then Europe and Asia (T4), followed by Central and East Asia (T5), and finally between East Asia and the Americas (T6). We also required T2 to be greater than T3. The model assumes no migration between regions following divergence; in support of this assumption, there is very little sequence sharing between regions. We do allow changes in population size. This model was first used to estimate divergence times with combined mtDNA and NRY sequences, then the model and estimated mean divergence times were used in separate simulations of the mtDNA and NRY sequences to estimate ancestral and current Nfand Nm.",
            "We obtained approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence from the 623 males in the HGDP, and complete mtDNA genome sequences from these 623 males plus an additional 329 females from the HGDP. The average coverage of the NRY sequences was 14.5X (range, 5X-37.5X, Additional file3: Figure S1), while for the mtDNA genome sequences the average coverage was 640X (range, 46X-4123X, Additional file3: Figure S1). After quality-filtering, imputation, and removal of sites with a high number of recurrent mutations, there remained 2,228 SNPs in the NRY sequences. The mtDNA analyses here are restricted to the 623 males for which NRY sequences were obtained, for which there were 2,163 SNPs; results based on the mtDNA genome sequences from the entire set of HGDP samples (952 individuals) did not differ from those based on the subset of 623 males (for example, Additional file3: Figure S2). More details about the results from each individual, including mtDNA and NRY haplogroups, are provided in Additional file1: Table S1. The mtDNA sequences have been deposited in Genbank with accession numbersKF450814-KF451871. A datafile with the alleles at each of the NRY SNPs in each sample has been provided to the CEPH-HGDP and additionally is available from the authors. The NRY raw sequencing data are in the European Nucleotide Archive with the study accession number PRJEB4417 (sample accession numbers ERS333252-ERS333873).",
            "Basic summary statistics for the mtDNA and NRY diversity in each population are provided in Additional file3: Table S3. As the sample sizes for many of the individual populations are quite small, for most subsequent analyses we grouped the populations into the following regions (based on analyses of genome-wide SNP data [43,47]): Africa, America, Central Asia, East Asia, Europe, Middle East/North Africa (ME/NA), and Oceania (the regional affiliation for each population is in Additional file1: Table S1). The Adygei, Hazara, and Uygur were excluded from these groupings as they show evidence of substantial admixture between these regional groups [43,47]. We stress that the use of regional names is a convenience to refer to these groupings of these specific populations, and should not be taken to represent the entirety of the regions (for example, \u2018Africa\u2019 refers to the results based on the analysis of the combined African HGDP samples, not to Africa in general).",
            "Some basic summary statistics concerning mtDNA and NRY diversity for the regions are provided in Table1. The \u03c0 values we report are for the most part somewhat larger than reported in a previous study of eight Africans and eight Europeans [50], which is not unexpected given the much larger sampling in our study. Notably, we find substantial variation among geographic regions in amounts of mtDNAversusNRY diversity; this is shown further in the comparison of the mean number of pairwise differences (mpd) for mtDNA and the NRY (Figure2A). The mtDNA mpd for Africa is about twice that for other regions, while the NRY mpd is greatest in the Middle East/North Africa region, and only slightly greater in Africa than in the other regions (with the exception of the Americas, which show substantially lower NRY diversity). Overall, there are striking differences in the ratio of NRY:mtDNA mpd (Table1), with Africa, Central Asia, and the Americas having significantly less NRY diversity relative to mtDNA diversity, compared to the other regional groups. Moreover, differences in relative levels of NRY:mtDNA diversity are also evident in the individual populations (Additional file3: Table S3), although the small sample sizes indicate that the individual population results must be viewed cautiously.",

            "An outstanding question is whether or not there are differences in the relative amounts of between-populationversuswithin-population diversity for mtDNAversusthe NRY, as some studies have found much larger between-population differences for the NRY than for mtDNA [6] while others have not [7]. To address this question, we carried out an AMOVA; the results (Figure2B) show that in the entire worldwide dataset, the between-population differences are indeed bigger for the NRY (approximately 36% of the variance) than for mtDNA (approximately 25% of the variance). However, there are substantial differences among the regional groups. The ME/NA, East Asia, and Europe regional groups follow the worldwide pattern in having bigger between-population differences for the NRY than for mtDNA. In contrast, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas have substantially bigger between-population differences for mtDNA than for the NRY, while for central Asia the between-population variation is virtually identical for the NRY and mtDNA. These regional differences likely reflect the influence of sex-biased migrations and admixture, as discussed in more detail below, and moreover indicate that focusing exclusively on the worldwide pattern of mtDNAversusNRY variation misses these important regional differences.",
            "We also investigated the relationship between geography and genetic distance. Despite the small sample sizes at the population level, both mtDNA and NRY \u03a6STdistances are significantly correlated with geographic distances between populations (Mantel tests with 1,000 replications: mtDNA, r\u2009=\u20090.41,P<0.001; NRY, r\u2009=\u20090.36,P=\u20090.002) as well as with each other (r\u2009=\u20090.23,P=\u20090.025). Thus, NRY and mtDNA divergence are both highly associated with geographic distances among populations.",
            "Although the primary purpose of this study is to compare demographic insights from mtDNA and NRY sequences that were obtained free of the ascertainment bias inherent in haplogroup-based approaches, we recognize that there is also useful information in the haplogroups. In this section we therefore present some haplogroup-based results. We first used a Bayesian method to estimate the phylogeny and divergence times for both mtDNA and the NRY (Figure3); for the latter, we used both a \u2018fast\u2019 mutation rate of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129/bp/year and a \u2018slow\u2019 mutation rate of 0.62\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129/bp/year as there is currently much uncertainty regarding mutation rates [5,40,41,51,52]. The resulting phylogenies are in general consistent with the existing mtDNA and NRY phylogenies [31,53], although there are some discrepancies, for example, in the mtDNA tree (Figure3A) L1 sequences group with L0 sequences rather than on the other side of the root, while additional discrepancies can be found in the NRY trees. However, all of these discrepancies involve nodes that have low support values (red asterisks in Figure3) and hence low confidence; the nodes that have strong support values are all in agreement with the existing mtDNA and NRY phylogenies. The inability of the Bayesian analysis to completely resolve the phylogenies has two causes: for the mtDNA phylogeny, frequent back mutations and parallel mutations at some sites confounds the analysis; for the NRY phylogenies, some branches in the accepted phylogeny are supported by only a few SNP positions that are not included in our sequence data.",

            "The age of the mtDNA ancestor is estimated to be about 160 thousand years ago (kya), and the ages of the non-African mtDNA lineages M and N are about 65 to 70 kya, in good agreement with previous estimates [54]. Our estimate for the age of the NRY ancestor is 103 kya based on the fast rate, and 165 kya based on the slow rate; however these estimates do not include the recently-discovered \u2018A00\u2019 lineage [41], which would result in much older ages for the NRY ancestor. The close agreement between the slow NRY ancestor age (165 kya) and the mtDNA ancestor age (160 kya) might be taken as evidence in favor of the slow NRY mutation rate. However, the slow NRY mutation rate gives an estimated age for the initial out-of-Africa divergence of about 100 kya, and an age for the divergence of Amerindian-specific haplogroup Q lineages of about 20 kya, while the fast rate gives corresponding estimates of about 60 kya for out-of-Africa and about 12.5 kya for Amerindian haplogroup Q lineages, in better agreement with the mtDNA and other evidence for these events [54-57]. Given the current uncertainty over mutation rate estimates, we have chosen to use either both estimates in further analyses (for example, Bayesian skyline plots) or an average of the fast and slow rates (for example, in simulation-based analyses); in Additional file3: Table S4 we provide divergence time estimates and associated 95% credible intervals for the branching events shown in the phylogenies in Figure3.",
            "NRY and mtDNA haplogroup frequencies per population are shown in Additional file3: Table S5 and Additional file3: Table S6, respectively. The mtDNA haplogroups were called from the sequences determined here, while the NRY haplogroups were previously determined by SNP genotyping [58,59]. The NRY haplogroup information we provide is taken only from these published data; we did not infer haplogroups from the sequences, in order to have an independent comparison of the NRY tree with the haplogroups. The phylogenetic relationships for the NRY sequences are generally concordant with the SNP-genotyping results (with some exceptions, discussed in the legends to Figures S3 to S12 in Additional file3). The haplogroup frequencies provide further insights into some of the different regional patterns of mtDNAversusNRY diversity noted previously. For example, the comparatively low diversity and smaller differences among populations for the NRY in Africa is due to the high frequency of NRY haplogroup E (55% to 100% in the non-Khoisan groups; Additional file3: Table S5). This haplogroup is widespread in western Africa, and specific subhaplogroups of haplogroup E are associated with the Bantu expansion [59-61]. The comparatively low NRY diversity in the HGDP Africa regional group thus likely reflects a \u2018homogenizing\u2019 effect of the Bantu expansion. NRY haplogroup E is also of interest because it occurs in some European and ME/NA groups, at frequencies of up to 17%, as well as in a few individuals from Central Asia (Additional file3: Table S5). Inspection of the phylogeny of haplogroup E sequences (Additional file3: Figure S7) reveals that all of the European and most of the ME/NA haplogroup E sequences form a clade distinct from the African haplogroup E sequences, and the age of this clade is about 18 kya. Moreover, all of the European haplogroup E sequences fall into a subclade that is about 14 kya. These results may reflect a migration from North Africa to Europe suggested from analyses of genome-wide SNP data [62], and would thus provide a timeframe for this migration.",
            "In Oceania, the bigger differences between populations for mtDNA than for the NRY (Figure2B, Table1) probably reflect the high frequency of mtDNA haplogroup B in just one of the two Oceania populations (75% in the Melanesian populationvs.0% in the Papuan population; Additional file3: Table S6). MtDNA haplogroup B is associated with the Austronesian expansion [63-65]. By contrast, NRY haplogroups associated with the Austronesian expansion, such as haplogroup O [63,66,67] are absent in the HGDP Oceania populations (Additional file3: Table S5). This contrast further testifies to the larger maternal than paternal impact of the Austronesian expansion on Oceanian populations [63,66-69].",
            "In the Americas, there are dramatic differences in mtDNA haplogroup frequencies among populations (the Karitiana and Surui are 100% haplogroup D, the Pima are 100% haplogroup C, the Maya are 100% haplogroup A, and the Colombians are 50% haplogroup B and 50% haplogroup C; Additional file3: Table S6), which are at least partly due to the small sample sizes but also in keeping with previous studies [70]. However, all NRY sequences from the Americas fall into haplogroup Q (with the exception of one Pima with a haplogroup G sequence that likely reflects recent European admixture), and overall NRY diversity is substantially reduced in the Americas, compared to mtDNA diversity (Table1, Figure2). While the small number of HGDP males from the Americas precludes any definitive statements, the apparently much greater mtDNA than NRY diversity in the Americas might indicate that fewer males than females were involved in the colonization of the Americas, and deserves further investigation.",
            "We note some additional features pertaining to specific populations in the individual NRY haplogroup phylogenies provided in Figures S3 to S12 in Additional file3, while the full mtDNA phylogeny for the HGDP samples is provided in Figure S13 in Additional file3.",
            "Sequence-based analysis of NRY variation permits demographic analyses that cannot be carried out with ascertained SNP genotype data, and which can then be compared directly to similar analyses of the mtDNA sequences. In the following demographic analyses, only the sequence data were used, and not any of the haplogroup information. We first estimated the history of population size changes via Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) for the NRY and mtDNA sequences for each region (Figure4). These results should be interpreted cautiously, both because of the small sample sizes for some of the regions (in particular, America and Oceania), and because grouping populations with different histories can produce spurious signals of population growth [71]. Moreover, the uncertainty concerning the NRY mutation rate makes it more difficult to compare the timing of population size changes for the NRYversusmtDNA. Nevertheless, both the mtDNA and NRY BSPs indicate overall population growth in almost all groups, but for mtDNA there is a more pronounced signal of growth at around 15,000 to 20,000\u00a0years ago than there is for the NRY, and during much of the past it appears as if the effective size for females was larger than that for males (Figure4).",

            "To further investigate female and male demographic history, we used simulations and ABC to estimate the current and ancestral effective population size for females (Nf) and males (Nm) for Africa, Europe, East Asia, Central Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. We also estimated the ancestral Nfand Nmfor the out-of-Africa migration. We first used the model in Figure1and the combined mtDNA and NRY sequences (using an average of the fast and slow mutation rates for the latter) to estimate the divergence times associated with this model (with the prior distributions for the divergence times given in Table2). Table2also provides measures of the reliability of the resulting parameter estimation based on the pseudo-observed values: average R2=\u20090.9, which exceeds the suggested threshold [72] of 10%; average coverage is 89% and factor 2 (proportion of estimated values for the statistics that are within 50% to 200% of the true value) is 90%; the average bias is 2% and relative mean square error (RMSE) is 9%. As these measures indicate satisfactory performance of the simulation [72], we retained the top 1,000 simulations (tolerance of 0.02%) for estimating the divergence times. In addition, the posterior distributions show a markedly improved fit to the summary statistics, compared to the prior distributions (Additional file3: Table S7, Figure S14). The resulting estimates of divergence times for the model in Figure1are provided in Table2, and are generally in good agreement with previous estimates for the divergence time among continental groups [45,73,74].",

Also shown are various statistics related to 1,000 pseudo-observed parameter estimations: R2is the proportion of the variance in the parameters explained by the summary statistics; Bias indicates whether the parameter tends to be over-estimated (positive bias) or under-estimated (negative bias); RMSE (root mean square error) is a distance between the true and estimated values of the parameter.",
            "Coverage is the proportion of times the true value for the parameter lies within the 90% credible interval around the parameter estimate; and Factor 2 is the proportion of estimated values that are within 50% and 200% of the true value.",
            "We next carried out separate simulations based on NRY and mtDNA sequences, respectively, and obtained ABC estimates of current and ancestral Nmand Nffor each regional group and for the out-of-Africa migration. Although the reliability measures indicate greater variance in the simulation results (Tables3and4), the posterior distributions still show a markedly improved fit to the summary statistics (Additional file3: Tables S8 and S9; Figures S15 and S16). The distribution of the estimated current and ancestral Nfand Nmare shown for each regional group in Figure5, and a pictorial summary is provided in Figure6. The simulation results suggest a small founding size in Africa of about 60 females and 30 males (all population sizes are effective population sizes); migration out of Africa about 75 kya associated with a bottleneck of around 25 females and 15 males; migrations from this non-African founding population to Oceania 61 kya, to Europe 49 kya, to Central and East Asia 37 kya, and from East Asia to the Americas about 15 kya. These divergence times are in reasonable agreement with those in the mtDNA and NRY phylogenies, given the wide confidence intervals on both (Table2, Additional file3: Table S4). There was concomitant population growth in all regions (with the most growth in East Asia); however, throughout history the mtDNA and NRY results indicate consistently larger effective population sizes for females than for males (except, possibly, in the ancestors of East Asians).",

            "We report here the development and implementation of a capture-based array method to enrich Illumina sequencing libraries for NRY sequences. We then used this method to obtain approximately 500\u00a0kb of NRY sequence for 623 males from 51 populations of the CEPH-HGDP, and we also obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences from the same individuals. The molecular resolution (that is, number of SNPs) provided by the NRY and mtDNA sequences was roughly equivalent overall (2,228 NRY SNPs,vs.2,163 mtDNA SNPs), allowing us to compare the maternal and paternal histories of human populations without the usual concerns about different methodologies (for example, mtDNA HV1 sequencesvs.genotyping NRY SNPs and/or STRs) having an influence on the results. However, note that in other respects the molecular resolution still differs between the mtDNA and NRY sequences, for example, we obtained complete mtDNA genome sequences but only partial NRY sequences.",
            "Our data provide new insights into the maternalversuspaternal history of humans. First, a longstanding controversy has been whether or not genetic differences between human populations are bigger, on average, for the NRY than for mtDNA. The first comparative study of human mtDNA and NRY diversity found significantly bigger differences between populations for the NRY than for mtDNA [6], which was attributed to a higher female than male migration rate between populations due to patrilocality. A subsequent study found bigger differences between populations for the NRY than for mtDNA in patrilocal populations and the opposite pattern in matrilocal populations, [75] which was viewed as supporting an influence of residence pattern and associated maleversusfemale migration rates on NRYversusmtDNA diversity. However, these studies used different methods to assay NRYversusmtDNA diversity; notably, a later study that used similar methods to assay NRY and mtDNA diversity (by comparing 6.7\u00a0kb of NRY sequence and 770\u00a0bp of mtDNA sequence in 389 individuals from 10 populations) concluded that genetic differences between populations were in fact similar for the NRY and mtDNA [7].",
            "Our results, based on a more comprehensive sampling of worldwide human populations, indicate that genetic differences among human populations at the global scale are indeed bigger for the NRY than for mtDNA, although the differences are not as large as suggested by previous studies (between-population variance of 36% for the NRYvs.25% for mtDNA in this study, compared to previous estimates of 65% for the NRYvs.20% for mtDNA [6]). More importantly, our results indicate substantial differences among regional groups in the between-group variance for the NRYversusmtDNA (Figure2) as well as in overall levels of NRYversusmtDNA diversity (Figure2, Table1). Thus, focusing on global patterns of variation misses this important regional variation, which (as discussed in more detail above in the Results) likely reflects differences in the paternalversusmaternal demographic history of specific human populations (for example, the large impact of the Bantu expansion on African NRY diversity [59,60], and of the Austronesian expansion on Oceanic mtDNA diversity [63,65]).",
            "Another question of interest is the extent to which the genetic contributions of malesversusfemales have been the same or differed (as measured by their respective effective population sizes, Nmand Nf, respectively). Previous studies of Nmand Nfhave largely relied on comparisons of X chromosome vs. autosomal variation, and have come to varying conclusions concerning the historical Nf/Nmratio, for example, finding that this ratio suggests a large excess of Nfto Nm[8], a moderate excess of Nfto Nm[76], or even a decreased Nfrelative to Nm[9]. These differences variously reflect methodological differences, difficulties in accounting for differences in maleversusfemale mutation rates, and/or the potentially greater effect of selection on the X chromosome than on the autosomes [10,11]. Comparison of mtDNAversusNRY variation offers a more direct assessment of Nf/Nmthat is free of some of the issues concerning X:autosome comparisons (albeit not all, as discussed below), but requires unbiased estimates of NRY variation, which until our study were only available from either whole genome sequencing studies [5,14-16] or more limited targeted studies of NRY sequence variation [7,77]. Our results indicate a consistent strong excess of NfversusNmstarting even before the out-of-Africa migration that has been carried through almost all subsequent migrations. East Asia may be an exception, and indeed our estimates of Nfand Nmare substantially larger than previous estimates of Nein east Asians based on autosomal diversity [78,79]. However, these previous studies were based solely on data from Han Chinese and Japanese, whereas the HGDP includes a much more diverse sampling of east Asian populations, which may account for the higher effective population size estimates for the HGDP. The excess of NfversusNmbecome even more pronounced in recent times due to higher rates of growth in Nfthan in Nm(Figures4,5, and6); these results are in line with previous studies of smaller datasets that used different methods [4,80]. These results suggest, in turn, that sex-specific processes that reduce Nm, such as polygyny and/or sex-specific migration [2], have characterized humans over most of our prehistory.",
            "However, there are several reasons why this conclusion should be viewed as tentative. First, the sample sizes of some of the regional groups in the HGDP are quite low, precluding confident estimates of effective population sizes. Moreover, there are some surprising features of our results, such as the much larger effective size estimates for East and Central Asians than for Europeans. Whether these features are truly indicative of these regions, or rather specific to the particular populations sampled in the HGDP, will require further studies to elucidate. Nonetheless, given that the HGDP overall is a much more comprehensive sampling of worldwide genetic diversity than in previous studies that estimated effective population sizes for various human populations, it perhaps is not surprising that we obtain different results.",
            "Second, while focusing on NRYversusmtDNA variation avoids some of the drawbacks of comparing Xversusautosomal DNA variation in estimating Nfand Nm, the uncertainty associated with the resulting estimates is significantly larger for NRY:mtDNA than for X:autosome comparisons. This is because the X:autosome comparisons are averaged across many independent loci, whereas the NRY and mtDNA are each just a single independent locus.",
            "Third, the model used in the simulations is obviously a very simplified version of reality, and indeed there are some clear differences between the observed values for some summary statistics and the posteriors (for example, the \u03a6STvalues in Figures S14 to S16 in Additional file3). In particular, to reduce the computational complexity we did not consider migration between regional groups (after the initial colonization events) in the simulations to estimate Nfand Nm. There is some justification for doing so, as in general migration within the regional groups has been more important than migration between regional groups, as evidenced by genetic structure analyses [43,47,81] and by attempts to estimate migration rates directly from genetic data [80]. Moreover, no mtDNA sequences are shared between regional groups, and only one NRY sequence is shared between regional groups, suggesting very limited recent migration between regional groups. Furthermore, by not including migration we are overestimating the ancestral Nfand Nm(because some of the diversity reflects later migration rather than genetic diversity that was present in the ancestral population). Thus, the effect of such migration would be even smaller estimates of Nfand Nmthan those we obtained. Still, in future analyses migration and other complexities should be considered.",
            "Fourth, we have here interpreted differences in levels of NRYversusmtDNA diversity and divergence as reflecting neutral, demographic history. However, a recent study has shown that background selection on the Y chromosome is probably also influencing levels of NRY diversity in human populations [50]. The substantial regional variation that we see in comparisons of mtDNAversusNRY diversity does suggest that there are regional differences in the demographic history of males and females, as it seems unlikely that levels of background selection would vary so drastically across human populations. Moreover, recently-described regional variation in ratios of X:autosomal diversity also point to sex-biased demographic processes [12]. Still, the overall differences we find in NmversusNfmay be influenced by background selection, and hence may not be as large as inferred by the simulations (for example, Figure6). More detailed investigations are warranted into the relative importance of background selectionversuspurely demographic processes in influencing regional variation in Nmvs. Nf.",
            "We have developed a rapid and cost-effective means of obtaining unbiased, high-resolution NRY sequence information. Comparative analysis of NRY and mtDNA sequences from a large sample of individuals and populations from the HGDP provides new insights into the comparative demographic history of males and females. In particular, we find on average larger genetic differences between populations for the NRY than for mtDNA (albeit with substantial regional variation), and that the effective population size of females has been larger than that of males throughout human history. We anticipate that using this approach to investigate additional populations should provide a rich source of new information about the genetic history of our species.",

            "High throughput sequencing (HTS) has been used for a number of years in the field of paleogenomics to facilitate the recovery of small DNA fragments from ancient specimens. Recently, these techniques have also been applied in forensics, where they have been used for the recovery of mitochondrial DNA sequences from samples where traditional PCR-based assays fail because of the very short length of endogenous DNA molecules. Here, we describe the biological sexing of a ~4000-year-old Egyptian mummy using shotgun sequencing and two established methods of biological sex determination (RXand RY), by way of mitochondrial genome analysis as a means of sequence data authentication. This particular case of historical interest increases the potential utility of HTS techniques for forensic purposes by demonstrating that data from the more discriminatory nuclear genome can be recovered from the most damaged specimens, even in cases where mitochondrial DNA cannot be recovered with current PCR-based forensic technologies. Although additional work remains to be done before nuclear DNA recovered via these methods can be used routinely in operational casework for individual identification purposes, these results indicate substantial promise for the retrieval of probative individually identifying DNA data from the most limited and degraded forensic specimens.",

            "On 18 October 2009, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA) opened an exhibition calledThe Secrets of Tomb 10A: Egypt 2000 BC. One of the most intriguing items in the collection was a mummified human head discovered over a century ago in the necropolis of Deir el-Bersha (also known as Dayr al-Barsh\u0101). The site is located on the east bank of the Nile River in close proximity to the city of Mallawi, approximately 250 km south of Cairo. Deir el-Bersha is known for tombs cut into cliffs of limestone that date back to the Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC), the First Intermediate Period (about 2100\u20132040 BC) and the Middle Kingdom (MK; 2040\u2013approx. 1640 BC). During the MK 11th and 12th Dynasties (2040\u20131783 BC), it served as the chief cemetery for the governors or regional lords (a.k.a. nomarchs) of the 15th Upper Egyptian Nome (a.k.a. the Hare Nome).",
            "In 1915, Deir el-Bersha was excavated by a joint MFA-Harvard University team directed by George A. Reisner with the assistance of Hanford L. Story and Said Ahmed Said [1]. On 23 April, Reisner\u2019s men began clearing the burial shaft from tomb number 10A. Six days later, at the bottom of a 30-foot pit, they discovered the burial chamber of an early MK governor named Djehutynakht. It is not yet clear whether he is Djehutynakht IV, son of Ahanakht I, or Djehutynakht V, son of Nehri I [1,2,3]. Both were nomarchs of the Hare Nome, and while they shared the same name (which means Thoth [the main local deity] is Strong), there is no evidence they were related. Tomb 10A contained a second occupant: the governor\u2019s wife, who was also called Djehutynakht. Although the tomb had been plundered in antiquity and most of the valuable jewels stolen, many objects were left behind. In fact, the recovered contents of Tomb 10A are considered one of the largest burial assemblages of the MK ever discovered. The funerary equipment includes pottery, canopic jars, models showing men and women in different daily life activities, nearly 60 model boats, and a famous, exquisitely carved and painted processional group composed of a priest and four offering bearers, known as the \u201cBersha procession\u201d [4]. Befitting their high status, the governor and his wife were both buried in finely decorated rectangular wooden coffins placed within larger coffins, all made of thick cedar of Lebanon boards. Upon discovery, the coffins of the governor were nearly intact with the exception of the head end that had been removed by tomb robbers. The intricate carvings and paintings on the governor\u2019s outer coffin make it an unparalleled masterpiece of MK art (see pictures in [5]).",
            "When the tomb was looted, the mummies of the governor and his wife were damaged by thieves in search of fine jewelry. A torso, originally attributed to Lady Djehutynakht, was found in the far corner of the burial chamber, but was recently argued to belong to the governor after re-excavation of Tomb 10A [6]. A mummified head, which could neither be attributed to the governor nor to his wife, was found atop the governor\u2019s coffin (Figure 1).",

            "In an effort to learn more, the head was analyzed with computerized tomography (CT) in 2005. The CT scanning of the head revealed extensive bilateral post-mortem alterations of the facial bones [7]. The absence of these bones, together with the lack of comparative data on ancient Egyptian skulls, preclude definitive morphological sex determination; however, the presence of large mastoid processes, robust occipital and temporal regions, and pronounced gonial flaring of the mandible, suggest that the skull more likely belonged to a man [8], (Figure S1). In order to unequivocally determine the biological sex of the individual, the MFA collaborated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory to perform DNA analysis.",
            "At the time the FBI was contacted, the ancient DNA community had largely given up on the testing of ancient Egyptian human remains. Though DNA extraction and amplification from ancient Egyptian samples had been attempted in the early days of paleogenetics, these initial attempts either resulted in failure (4500-year-old human femurs [9]) or yielded data that turned out to be the product of modern DNA contamination (2400-year-old mummy [10] and 1600-year-old sacred monkey bones from the Saqqara Baboon Galleries [11]), both contaminated with modern human DNA). These early failures prompted studies on DNA survival [9,12]. Together with older research showing that DNA degradation (depurination in particular) is primarily influenced by temperature, pH, oxygen, and water [13], these analyses suggested that Egyptian environmental conditions likely cause DNA to degrade to fragments smaller than 100 base pairs (bp) in just a few hundred years [14,15].",
            "Currently, forensic DNA testing at the FBI, as well as in nearly all global operational laboratories, is based on targeted PCR amplification of fragments ranging from 90\u20131200 bp in size, followed by size-based capillary electrophoresis for short tandem repeats (STRs) or Sanger sequencing for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These approaches have served the forensic community well over the past twenty years. They present limitations, however, to both the quality and quantity of genetic data that can be recovered from the most challenging specimens. Recently, a number of commercial high throughput sequencing (HTS) assays, designed specifically for forensic applications, have become available [16,17]. While these assays overcome many of the limitations of traditional capillary electrophoresis-based forensic DNA analyses, they are still based on targeted amplification of defined genomic regions. As a result, their utility is limited to samples harboring DNA fragments large enough for PCR amplification.",
            "One of the primary advantages of HTS is that DNA fragments of very short size can be recovered and sequenced, thus obviating the need for targeted PCR. Here, we exploit this feature and describe the use of shotgun sequencing to determine the biological sex of a 4000-year-old Egyptian mummy.",
            "In 2009, a second mandibular molar, in pristine condition, was extracted from the skull using a flexible fiber optic endoscope with grasping forceps [18]. Immediately following its extraction, the molar was placed in a sterile container and sent to a DNA laboratory where it was embedded in epoxy and cut in two parts (see photo inFigure 2). The block containing the crown and upper roots (~2/3 of the tooth) was sent to the FBI Laboratory and later to the Harvard Medical School (HMS) ancient DNA facility.",

            "Sequencing strategy in this study. Molecular work performed at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory is in blue, while work performed at Harvard Medical School (HMS) is in pink. Cap1-Lib2 has both colors because the extraction and library preparation of Lib2 was done at the HMS, while the hybridization capture took place at the FBI. CAP-LIB1 is the result of merging data from runs I and II, while CAP-LIB2 is the result of merging runs III and IV. Lib1 and Lib2 were shotgun-sequenced together on the HiSeq at National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC, run V).",
            "Given our understanding that the recovery of DNA from a 4000-year-old Egyptian mummy specimen would be challenging, if not impossible, the first goal was to determine whether any endogenous mitochondrial DNA could be recovered from the sample. On a practical level, the high copy number of the mitochondrial genome (mtGenome) per cell significantly improves the chances of recovering genetic material from ancient samples. Furthermore, because consistently higher HTS coverage is achieved with mtDNA than with nuclear DNA, the authenticity of the genetic data can be more easily addressed. Data authenticity was assessed in three ways. First, the average size of the human mtDNA sequences was determined bioinformatically. Given the ancient Egyptian origin of the sample, the recovered fragments were expected to be very small as a result of DNA degradation over time, while modern contamination would be more likely to contain longer fragments. Second, the occurrence and pattern of one particular type of DNA damage was evaluated. Hydrolytic deamination results in the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the DNA. It is one of the most abundant forms of damage in aged DNA molecules and manifests in the final DNA sequence data as conversion of cytosine to thymine (C-T) or, in the reverse complementary sequence, guanine to adenine (G-A), especially at the ends of molecules [19,20,21]. Finally, the rate of modern DNA contamination in the data was estimated by comparing the data to modern human mtDNA diversity. As mtDNA is a haploid marker, contaminating molecules can be more easily detected than is possible with diploid nuclear DNA.",
            "A full description of the sample preparation is provided in theSupplementary Material.",
            "At the FBI Laboratory, DNA was extracted from 105 mg of dentin powder using a silica column-based protocol [22]. In order to remove damaged bases, the extract and associated extraction reagent control (RB) were treated for one hour with the USERTMkit, which contains a mixture of Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG) and Endo VIII (New England BioLabs, a.k.a. NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). At the library preparation stage, a third sample, containing only water, was introduced (negative control or NC). Illumina libraries were generated for each sample (Lib1, Lib1/RB, Lib1/NC) using the NEBNext Ultra II for Illumina kit and NEB looped adaptors. After amplification and indexing, all three libraries were subjected to hybridization capture to enrich for human mtDNA with a MyBait1 kit (Arbor Biosciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and the post-capture products (cap-Lib1; cap-Lib1/RB; cap-Lib1/NC) were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq FGX at the FBI Laboratory (Figure 2). Having established the presence of endogenous DNA at the FBI Laboratory, the tooth was sent to the HMS, where a second extract and library were prepared.",
            "At the HMS, DNA was extracted from 68 mg of powder using the protocols published in [23] and [24]. The extract, and associated RB and NC, were treated with UDG according to [25]. By using this treatment, called \u201cpartial UDG removal\u201d, almost all the uracil present in the ancient DNA molecules are removed except a few located at the ends of the molecule. Next, three Illumina libraries (Lib2, Lib2/RB, and Lib2/NC) were prepared according to [26]. Fifteen microliters of barcoded Lib2, and 10 \u00b5L of Lib2/RB and Lib2/NC were shipped to the FBI Laboratory where 5 \u03bcL of each library was dual-indexed with eight cycles of PCR. At the FBI Laboratory, mtDNA hybridization capture was performed on the three Harvard libraries using a MyBait1 kit. Cap1-Lib2/RB and cap1-Lib2/NC were sequenced on the MiSeq FGX while cap-Lib1 and cap1-Lib2 were sequenced together on a HiSeq 2500 at the National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC). A second mtDNA enrichment on Lib2, Lib2/RB and Lib2/NC was performed at the HMS using a pool of oligonucleotides, synthesized on a microarray (CustomArray Inc., Bothell, WA, USA). Cap2-Lib2, cap2-Lib2/RB, and cap2-Lib2/NC were sequenced at the HMS on a NextSeq 500.",

            "Libraries sequenced on the HiSeq or the MiSeq FGX were analyzed at NBFAC. After conversion from BCL to FASTQ format, the HiSeq files were de-multiplexed and the adaptors removed. CutAdapt (v1.9.1; [27]) was used to remove the 7 bp barcodes in Lib2 and cap1-Lib2. For every run except the NextSeq run, paired reads were mapped to the human genome hg19 and the revised Cambridge reference sequence rCRS (NC012910; [28]) using the Burrows\u2013Wheeler Aligner (BWA aln v.0.7.13-r1126; [29]) with the parameters recommended by [30] (\u201c\u2212l 16500 \u2212n 0.01 \u2212o 2\u201d). SAMtools (v1.3.1; [31]) was used to extract mapped reads, merge the BAM files from all HiSeq lanes, and remove mapped reads with a quality score (Q) less than 30. The Picard program v.1.96 [32]) was used to remove duplicates. Data for cap2-Lib2, cap2-lib2/RB and cap2-lib2/NC were analyzed at HMS according to [33]. BAM files of all three alignments were sent to the FBI. At the FBI, all mappings were imported into the CLC Genomics Workbench program (v.10.0.1; Qiagen/CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) for visualization. Finally, variants were called using the CLC Fixed Ploidy tool.",

Similarly, data produced with cap1-Lib2 and cap2-Lib2 (runs III and IV) were merged into a CAP-LIB2 file (Figure 2). For all data sets, duplicates were removed after merging. Reads shorter than or equal to 35 bp were removed from all data sets to avoid spurious microbial alignments (as suggested by [34]) and reads longer than 70 bp (that could potentially originate from modern contaminants) were removed before variant calling. Data observed in the reagent blanks and negative controls were mapped and analyzed using the same parameters.",

            "Two established methods that have been successfully applied in a number of previous studies [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56] were used to determine the sex of the individual from whom the tooth was obtained. Biological sex was first determined using RY[30], which is defined as the number of reads that mapped to chromosome Y (nY) divided by the number of reads mapped to both the X and Y chromosomes (nX + nY). The 95% confidence interval (CI) is defined as RY\u00b1 1.96 standard error (SE), where SE = \u221a[(RYx (1 \u2212 RY))/nX + nY]. The results are indicative of a female when the upper bound of the 95% CI is less than 0.016, whereas the results are indicative of a male when the lower bound of the CI is greater than 0.075.",
            "The second method, RX[57], compares the number of sequences originating from the X chromosome to the number of sequences originating from the 22 autosomes. Molecular sex is assigned male if the upper bound of the 95% CI is less than 0.60, and female if the lower bound is greater than 0.80 (see RXCI definition in theSupplementary Material).",
            "In order to mitigate against the possible impact of modern contaminants on the calculation, RXand RYwere also determined using only reads showing signs of damage, as these reads are unlikely to have originated from modern contaminants [58]. Read filtering was performed using PMDtools (v0.50; [58]) with a threshold of three, as recommended by the author of the program.",

            "Despite the fact that DNA damage resulting from deamination slowly accumulates over time, deamination does not strictly correlate with sample age. Environmental conditions, in addition to age, can significantly impact DNA damage. High temperatures and humidity generally increase the speed of degradation, while cold and dry climates generally favor preservation. A 22,000-year-old bone preserved in permafrost can exhibit a C-T substitution frequency at the 5\u2019 end of less than 0.20 [59], while a much younger, 6500-year-old human tooth found in Spain can exhibit rates greater than 0.25 [44]. Even if the C-T substitution frequency cannot be used as a strict dating tool, deamination rates are generally expected to be greater than 0.1 in unrepaired DNA extracted from samples greater than 500 years of age that have not been preserved in ice [60].",
            "In the present study, the C-T substitution frequency at the 5\u2019 end of the mtDNA reads in Cap-Lib1 was 0.27 (Figure S2A). This high value was somewhat unexpected since the extract had been treated with UDG (an enzyme that cleaves uracil) and only sporadic uracil bases should have remained. These results suggest that the reaction was partially or completely inhibited. Conversely, and as expected for the partial UDG treated cap1-Lib2, very few uracil bases remained in the mtDNA reads, resulting in a nucleotide misincorporation rate of 0.084 at the 5\u2019 end (Figure S2C). Since it has been shown in [25] that a successful \u201cpartial UDG treatment\u201d generally results in the misincorporation rate to be reduced by three-fold, it is likely that our USER reaction performed on Lib1 was completely inhibited.",
            "Sequencing statistics for the reagent blank and negative control libraries are presented inTable 1. No signs of measurable human contamination that could have impacted results from the tooth were observed.

The value for Lib1 is consistent with the rates observed in other ancient DNA studies [44,46,48,49,50,51,52,61,62,63,64,65,66]. Though the estimated contamination rate in Lib2 was somewhat higher, it had no effect on consensus calling for the endogenous molecules, as the same mtGenome profile was recovered from both libraries.",

The sequence closest to the mummy\u2019s belongs to a contemporary individual from Lebanon (KT779192[67]); however, the two haplotypes still differ at five positions, three of them in the control region (CR). A comparison between the mummy CR and the 26,127 CR sequences from the EMPOP database produced no match.",

The dominant haplogroups among this dataset were haplogroup T (11.98%) and L3 (11.23%;Table S3). Out of the 64 individuals who belonged to haplogroup U, seven belonged to haplogroup U5 (1.05%), and three (0.5%) belonged to one of the U5b subgroups (U5b1c; U5b1d1a; U5b2a5).",

However, related U5b2b sequences have been observed in ancient human remains from Europe, and a haplogroup U5b2c1 haplotype was recently discovered in 2000-year-old remains from Phoenicia [67]. When only the mtDNA sequences recovered from ancient Egyptian human remains are considered, the Djehutynakht sequence most closely resembles a U5a lineage from sample JK2903, a 2000-year-old skeleton from Abusir el-Meleq [74].",

Although aliquots of libraries Lib1 and Lib2 were mixed (50/50) and sequenced together on the HiSeq, the Lib2 data values were, for all measures, substantially higher than the Lib1 values. This is perhaps due to the smaller overall size of the HMS library fragments (Figure S3). As smaller fragments are known to be preferentially sequenced on Illumina platforms, the smaller average size of the HMS library likely explains the greater numbers of raw paired reads, reads that mapped to the human genome, and unique mapped reads.",

The percentage of mtDNA reads in each of the two libraries was <0.1%, in contrast to the mtDNA capture libraries, where it was 10.9% in Cap-Lib1 and 19.7% in Cap1-Lib2. The average coverage of the mtGenome using shotgun data was too low to produce a full profile. However, when variants could be called (minimum of five reads and a frequency \u226580%), they were in agreement with the profile produced by the hybridization capture data.

For both shotgun libraries (Lib1 and Lib2), the calculated lower bound of the RYconfidence interval was >0.075, regardless of whether all reads or only reads showing signs of deamination were used. Values greater than >0.075 point to a male. Similarly, and again regardless of whether or not undamaged molecules were included in the calculations, data from both Lib1 and Lib2 produced an upper bound for the RXconfidence interval that was less than 0.6.

            "For nearly a century, the contents of Tomb 10A have been studied by archaeologists, philologists, and art historians. Based on the styles of pottery, the many wooden sculptures and, of course, the decorations and texts on governor Djehutynakht\u2019s coffins, the tomb has been firmly dated to within a generation between the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th Dynasties (1961\u20132010 BC; [3,75]). The head is clearly original to the tomb. While, for genetic testing purposes, carbon dating of the specimen would have been ideal to further establish its age, additional manipulations were unfortunately impossible, given the value of the head as an object of art. However, several features of both the head and the tomb point clearly to the head originating from one of the original tomb occupants. For one, there is no evidence that the tomb was later reused despite it having been looted in antiquity. No artifacts or tomb contents dating to a later period have been found; in fact, additional human bones found in one of the shafts of Tomb 10A during a more recent 2009 expedition at Deir el-Bersha still support the conclusion that the chamber was used as the resting place for only two individuals [6]. The preparation of the head itself is consistent with the dating of the artifacts in the tomb (1961\u20132010 BC). The head displays rather archaic mummification practices, namely, facial features that were modeled in linen and then painted. This type of treatment was common during the Old Kingdom, but progressively disappeared during the MK [76,77,78]. Indeed, the eyes and lips of Djehutynakht\u2019s head were padded and his eyebrows painted (Figure 1). Similar features have been observed in another Deir-el Bersha mummy slightly predating Djehutynakht\u2019s era. The mummy of Henu, recovered from a completely undisturbed late First Intermediate Period (~2100\u20132040 BC) tomb, exhibits the same characteristics regarding facial modeling [79]. As these particular mummification practices did not persist through the MK and later, this feature supports the position that the Tomb 10A head is contemporaneous with the rest of the tomb\u2019s early MK contents [76]. All told, from art history, anthropological, and archaeological perspectives, the facts point to the mummy head belonging to one of the original Tomb 10A occupants: a MK nomarch of the late 11th or early 12th Dynasty or his wife.",
            "At the time DNA testing was performed on the tooth, and for reasons previously discussed, very little had been published on DNA recovery from ancient Egyptian human remains. Only one publication including HTS and quality control measures was available in early 2016, which described the mtGenome sequencing of an Egyptian mummy from the Greco-Roman period. The individual belonged to mtDNA haplogroup I2 [80]. Two other studies describing mtDNA recovery from ancient African samples were also available at the time, but centered on skeletons from more southern regions of the continent. One described the L0d2c1c lineage mtGenome of a 2330-year-old male skeleton from South Africa [81], while the other described the recovery of a L3x2a mtGenome from the remains of a 4500-year-old individual from Ethiopia [82].",
            "Given limited available data and the fact that U5 is the dominant mitochondrial haplogroup found among hunter-gatherers in Europe [83,84], the recovery of a haplogroup U5b2b5 sequence from the mummy of Djehutynakht raises the question of data authenticity, despite the molecular metrics suggesting otherwise. When the mummy\u2019s mtDNA sequence is viewed in the context of modern mtDNA diversity, however, the observed U5 lineage could potentially reflect interactions between Egypt and the Near East that date as far back as the Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods [85]. Trade between Egypt and the Near East is evidenced by, among other things, ceramic imports to Egypt [86]. In addition, dwellings similar to those found in Palestine suggest some immigration to Egypt from more arid Near Eastern areas from the late Predynastic to the Old Kingdom [85,87]. Both trade and immigration between Egypt and the Near East continued to increase over time. Demand in Egypt for cedar of Lebanon wood (a wood available and harvested in Lebanon and Syria during the MK) led to the further establishment of trade routes between Egypt and the Levant [85,86]. It is interesting, and perhaps not coincidental, that the individual with the mtDNA sequence most similar to Djehutynakht comes from a Lebanese individual.",
            "On top of this historical information offering an explanation for the observed mtDNA data are now additional, recently published, mtGenomes from Africa, and Egypt in particular. MtDNA haplotypes recently obtained from ancient human remains from sub-Saharan Africa belong only to haplogroup L subgroups [65,88]. However, nearly all of the remains excavated in the Northern part of the continent belong to Eurasian mtDNA lineages [63,67,74,89,90]. In fact, of the 114 mtDNA genomes now available from northern African ancient human remains, only one belongs to an African lineage (L3 observed in a skeleton from Abusir el-Meleq [74]). The deep presence of Eurasian mtDNA lineages in Northern Africa has, therefore, been clearly established with these recent reports and offers further support for the authenticity of the Eurasian mtDNA sequence observed in the Djehutynakht mummy. In the present study, Near Eastern influence has been found in an individual of high social status who lived in Upper Egypt during the Middle Kingdom.",
            "All currently employed capillary electrophoresis-based human DNA identification methods, as well as recently released commercial HTS assays developed for forensic applications, are based on targeted PCR approaches requiring endogenous DNA fragments, sometimes as small as 70 bp [91] but generally >100 bp. In forensic cases involving the most limited and degraded specimens (e.g., burnt bones, touch DNA, or single hair shafts), the DNA is often too damaged to yield amplicons of that size. Even in those instances for which DNA typing is successful with currently employed technologies, results are generally purposely limited to small regions of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Previous DNA analyses of the Djehutynakht tooth, prior to its receipt by the FBI, are consistent with these trends. Testing performed on the root end of the tooth (Figure 2) between 2009 and 2012 by two different laboratories that used traditional PCR approaches and amplicons as small as 80 bp failed.",
            "The utility of capture-based and shotgun HTS approaches for these types of difficult samples has been recognized for some time in forensics. A number of studies have demonstrated the utility of HTS in recovering DNA from samples recalcitrant to standard PCR. DNA has been recovered from severely degraded human remains [92,93,94,95] as well as single shed hairs [96]. All work to date, however, has focused exclusively on the mitochondrial genome. The mtDNA results produced here further support the use of HTS techniques for the recovery of accurate and reliable complete mtGenome data from severely degraded specimens, and from capture-based data in particular. However, the data described here also expand on these mtDNA-only approaches by demonstrating the recovery of authentic data from the much more discriminating nuclear genome.",
            "Nuclear DNA testing in forensics is currently based on autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) loci, and, thus, STRs would be the logical target marker for individual identification purposes. Unfortunately, due to their relatively large size, successful targeted amplification of STRs is rare with highly degraded samples. In addition, STRs are difficult to recover from shotgun data in these types of specimens. Not only is the full length of the repeat region rarely intact, but small recovered fragments of repetitive sequence are also unlikely to include enough genome-specific flanking regions to allow for proper mapping. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), however, can be used for individual identification [97,98,99], and these could be typed using hybridization capture and HTS. SNPs are already being targeted by the ancient DNA community to determine Y haplogroups [74,88,100], assess kinship [89], and test models of human population history and evolution [41,61,62,64,65,66,100,101,102]. For these types of questions, thousands of nuclear SNPs are often targeted, and low coverage of even a subset is generally sufficient to answer the question at hand.",
            "For forensics and other regulated disciplines (e.g., clinical genetics), where questions pertain specifically to individual genetic profiles, strict metrics for profile accuracy and reliability must be met. For example, adequate depth of coverage must be established to ensure SNP genotyping accuracy, and proper analytical thresholds must be set to capture stochasticity in allelic sampling, laboratory processes, and data analysis workflows [103,104]. These data quality metrics must furthermore be met with time-efficient and cost-effective workflows. Thus, while proof of principle studies in the ancient DNA and, now, forensics disciplines demonstrate recovery of endogenous nuclear DNA from severely compromised specimens, more developmental work is clearly required to enable standard forensic application of these techniques.",
            "Over the past year, molecular techniques developed and routinely used by the ancient DNA community have finally permitted the recovery of endogenous DNA from ancient Egyptian remains. Here, those techniques were employed to recover the complete mtGenome of the 4000-year-old mummy, Djehutynakht, and to determine that the biological sex was male. Although these approaches have been recently adopted and implemented by the forensic community to develop probative mitochondrial DNA data from the most degraded specimens, further work is needed for the recovery of individually identifiable nuclear DNA markers. Assays will need to be optimized and cost-effective workflows developed to achieve accurate and reliable calls from limited quantities of damaged nuclear DNA. In the meantime, the work described here represents a first step towards further improving forensic DNA testing capabilities in such cases.",

            "The Phoenicians emerged in the Northern Levant around 1800 BCE and by the 9thcentury BCE had spread their culture across the Mediterranean Basin, establishing trading posts, and settlements in various European Mediterranean and North African locations. Despite their widespread influence, what is known of the Phoenicians comes from what was written about them by the Greeks and Egyptians. In this study, we investigate the extent of Phoenician integration with the Sardinian communities they settled. We present 14 new ancient mitogenome sequences from pre-Phoenician (~1800 BCE) and Phoenician (~700\u2013400 BCE) samples from Lebanon (n = 4) and Sardinia (n = 10) and compare these with 87 new complete mitogenomes from modern Lebanese and 21 recently published pre-Phoenician ancient mitogenomes from Sardinia to investigate the population dynamics of the Phoenician (Punic) site of Monte Sirai, in southern Sardinia. Our results indicate evidence of continuity of some lineages from pre-Phoenician populations suggesting integration of indigenous Sardinians in the Monte Sirai Phoenician community. We also find evidence of the arrival of new, unique mitochondrial lineages, indicating the movement of women from sites in the Near East or North Africa to Sardinia, but also possibly from non-Mediterranean populations and the likely movement of women from Europe to Phoenician sites in Lebanon. Combined, this evidence suggests female mobility and genetic diversity in Phoenician communities, reflecting the inclusive and multicultural nature of Phoenician society.",
            "The Phoenicians, one of the great ancient civilizations, brought together East and West; they linked Asia, Europe and Africa through their trade networks and settlements, and they created the ancestral alphabet to most of the Western world today. They were skilled navigators whose trade networks extended throughout the entire Mediterranean basin, and they had taken an Egyptian-sponsored circumnavigation of Africa long before the Vikings ventured out of the sight of land [1,2]. From their homeland in what is today Lebanon, the Phoenicians sailed extensively across the Mediterranean for trade and established settlements in Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Ibiza, the Iberian Peninsula and along the North African coast, most notably, Carthage (Fig 1). Their naval dominance was respected throughout the Mediterranean, and they provided maritime support to the Persians and the Egyptians.",
            "",
            "Arrows indicate maritime movement. Blue dots indicate coastal sites and pink shaded areas indicate the extent of Phoenician settlements.",
            "Despite their enduring influence, scant historical documentation attributed directly to the Phoenicians exists. Most of the Phoenician historic documents were written on papyrus, and have not survived or been discovered yet. What we do know of them is what others, the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians wrote about them. They were never a unified political state or distinct ethnicity within their homeland [3]. The emerging coastal city-states of Byblos and Sidon thrived as maritime trade centers during the 3rdand 2ndmillennia BCE and later, the city of Tyre. During the 1stmillennium BCE their occupants were referred to by the Greeks, and thus today, as the Phoenicians (from the Greek,Phoin\u00edk\u0113, or purple country) in reference to their production of the valuable purple dye used in textile production. Prior to this, however, the region was occupied by Canaanites who, due to political events in the north, south and east, were confined to the thin coastal strip between the steep, cedar covered mountains of Lebanon and the eastern Mediterranean [3]. This coastal isolation meant that Phoenicians could only expand westwards, and this they did. Targeting sources of valuable metals including silver and tin, they established settlements across the Mediterranean and dominated maritime trade networks for centuries.",
            "Starting in the middle of 8thcentury BCE the Assyrians waged war on the Phoenicians and soon after they brought them under their yoke. With the decline of Phoenician influence in the east, Carthage, a city that was settled by Phoenicians fleeing Tyre in 813 BCE, became the centre of western Phoenician, or Punic, dominance until its destruction in 146 BCE by the Romans in the 3rd Punic War. Carthage, like many of the early Phoenician cities around the Mediterranean, adopted many of the rituals and features of their homeland.",
            "The island of Sardinia, like Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, and Ibiza, was a significant location in the early Phoenician trade routes to the Iberian and North African coasts, and later in the Punic interaction sphere. Phoenician settlements were established primarily along the south and west coast of Sardinia, with two of the earliest located at Sulcis and, slightly inland, Monte Sirai. As was common in Phoenician Sardinia, Monte Sirai was built next to previous Nuragic tower used by the first inhabitants like a shrine. The necropolis at Monte Sirai was one of the largest Punic burial sites in Sardinia and was used between the end of 7thand the first half of 4thcentury BCE. This period of use coincides with the Carthaginian dominion in Sardinia (starting at the end of 6thcentury BCE).",
            "Genetic research on modern populations in Lebanon and the Levant, the homeland of the Phoenicians, shows that much of the genetic structure of the region today is influenced by historic migrations associated with the spread of major religions\u2013Christians, Muslims and Druze [4]. Research on the Y chromosome DNA of men currently living in locations of historic Phoenician influence from across the Mediterranean, compared with men from nearby locations with no evidence of Phoenician contact, has identified likely Phoenician Y chromosome markers. These markers were present in more than 6% of the men living in Phoenician-influenced locations around the Mediterranean and in more than 30% of Lebanese men [5]. Comparative analyses of uniparental genetic markers in modern Lebanese indicate different genetic histories between males and females, with significantly more European lineages evident in the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than observed for the paternally inherited Y chromosome [6]. When these European-derived lineages were integrated into the Lebanese population is not yet fully resolved. If identified, mitochondrial markers associated with Phoenician settlement around the Mediterranean may help document the movement of women within the Phoenician networks. They can also be used to indicate how much integration with indigenous inhabitants occurred in Phoenician settlements. We now have the opportunity to investigate the genetic and cultural history of the Phoenicians and their spread across the Mediterranean through the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) from skeletal remains recovered from pre-Phoenician, Phoenician and Punic archaeological sites across the Mediterranean.",
            "Here we describe the results of analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes of ancient samples recovered from three Phoenician sites in Lebanon and Sardinia and one slightly earlier Middle Bronze Age site in Lebanon. We compare these results to modern mitochondrial genome data from Lebanese populations and recently published, pre-Phoenician ancient Sardinian mitogenome data to identify possible Phoenician/Punic-introduced mitochondrial haplotypes and attempt to reconstruct the history of interactions and the Phoenician genetic influence on modern population diversity.",
            "A total of 28 ancient tooth samples were obtained for aDNA analyses from four archaeological sites in Lebanon, BEY 197, BEY 198, Saifi 477, and Tell Fadous-Kfarabida, and one site, Monte Sirai, in Sardinia. Permits and approval for this study were obtained from the office of the Director General of Antiquities in Lebanon (permit number 4290, 6 November 2015) for all Lebanese samples and from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (prot. No. 5844, 17 March 2016), Superintendent of Archaeology in Cagliari) for the Monte Sirai samples. The Sardinian samples are held in the laboratory of archaeology \"Sabatino Moscati\" located at the Segni's Palace, University of Sassari, and the Lebanese samples are stored with the Directorate General of Antiquities, in Beirut, Lebanon.",
            "Two closely related sites, BEY 197 and BEY 198, were excavated in 2012 and 2013, and are located at the center of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. The archaeological context of the samples we studied from BEY 198 relates to the late Phoenician, Achaemenid period (539\u2013330 BCE). In addition to the stratigraphy, a pilgrim flask, a dish, a pitcher, a gold ring and red carnelian beads were found in the tomb, enabling accurate dating of this archaeological context. This tomb, heavily demolished during construction works in the 2nd century BCE, contains skeletal remains belonging to several individuals, most probably four persons, including one adolescent and a child. The remains were found in a funerary chamber dug in the rock [7]. The excavated grave in BEY 197 is an inhumation burial found in a high state of fragmentation with extensive penetrating erosion. The single skeleton was laid inside a rectangular cut (pit) in bedrock with an (E-W) orientation and was covered by a yellowish-reddish, compact to weakly cemented, cobble/sand fill. The provisional dating assigned to this grave ranges between the 4th and the 1st century BCE [8].",
            "The Saifi 477 site is also located in Beirut and was excavated between 2013 and 2014 [9]. The skeletal remains in this site were found in pits excavated in the geological substrate. Pits containing children and not adults were lined and covered with pebbles. The deceased were placed on their backs and their limbs were in an extended position. Two of the skeletons from which our samples were obtained were accompanied with funeral material: an adult wore a thick copper alloy bracelet around the right leg and a child with a copper alloy bracelet around each ankle. All these burial rituals are consistent with a 5th\u20144thcentury BCE date.",
            "The fourth site in Lebanon was at Tell Fadous-Kfarabida, a town situated 2 km south of the coastal town of Batroun, and revealed the presence of three Middle Bronze Age tombs. Excavations on this site started in 2007 and the skeletal remains for this study were unearthed between 2007 to 2010. The pottery from the three tombs is quite homogeneous and can be dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age I (~1800 BCE). This dating is also supported by a scarab found with one of the burials which dates to the late 12th to 13th Egyptian Middle Kingdom Dynasty [10,11].",
            "The archaeological site of Monte Sirai is a hill-top settlement located in Carbonia, south-western Sardinia, Italy. The site is comprised of three large sectors: the main sector of the settlement, the \u201cacropolis\u201d, located in the southern portion of the hill; the sacred place, or \u201ctophet\u201d, located in the northern portion of the site, and the large necropolis located in the valley separating the settlement from the tophet (S1 Fig). Archaeological evidence indicates that Monte Sirai was founded by Phoenicians in the last quarter of 8thcentury BCE, and totally abandoned during the 1stcentury BCE. The necropolis contained several tomb types including inhumations of single and multiple individuals, primary cremations,enchytrismoi(child burials in transport amphorae) and semi-combustions. The first excavations of the site were carried out in the 1960s, and again in the 1980s [12], though systematic excavations, involving a large graveyard area, began in 2005 and are on-going [13,14]. Samples were obtained during the 2015 field season from a range of burial contexts including three single pit burials; one jar burial; and two group burials, one containing four, and the other, two individuals, all dating from the period between the end of 6th and the first decades of 4th century BCE.",
            "A total of 16 ancient tooth samples were obtained from the four archaeological sites in Lebanon: 2 from BEY 197, 8 from BEY 198, 4 from Saifi and 2 from Tell Fadous-Kfarabida. From Sardinia, 12 tooth samples were obtained from burials recovered during the 2015 excavations at the Punic necropolis of Monte Sirai.",
            "The modern Lebanese DNA collection consisted of 87 samples that were collected by our team from volunteers representing the various communities across Lebanon, who provided information about their place of birth and the geographical origins of three generations of Lebanese maternal ancestry. A written informed consent was signed and obtained by each participant prior to recruitment. The study protocol and the informed consent form were approved by the IRB of the Lebanese American University. Study methods were carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.",
            "Complete mitogenome data from 21 ancient, pre-Phoenician samples from Sardinia used for comparative analyses here are from Olivieri et al. [15].",
            "All archaeological samples were sent to the purpose-built ancient DNA facility [16] at the University of Otago for processing. DNA extraction, library preparation and in-solution hybridization capture of the mitochondrial genomes were conducted using methods described previously [17]. Post-capture libraries were purified, quantified, pooled and were then run on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform in a 2 x 75 base paired-end run.",
            "The complete mitochondrial genomes for 87 modern Lebanese samples were prepared and sequenced using methods described previously [17].",
            "Ancient DNA sequences were also processed following the protocols described previously [17]. Specifically, ancient sequences were subjected to AdapterRemoval [18], where sequencing adaptors, reads with stretches of Ns, bases with quality scores of <30 and short reads (<25 bp) were removed. Additionally, where paired end fragments overlapped by at least 11 base pairs, reads were merged. Merged and unmerged reads were aligned separately with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) using recommended ancient DNA settings in which seeding was disabled (-l 1024), gap opens was set to 2 (-o 2) and maximum edit distance was set to 0.03 (-n0.03) [19]. To test for contamination with laboratory reagents, all reads were mapped to a composite reference genome constructed using the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) for humans [20], along with the reference mitochondrial genomes for cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa) and chicken (Gallus gallus) (GenBank refsNC_006853, NC_0012095.1 andNC_001323.1). The contamination ratio was determined by calculating the ratio of all reads with mapping quality > = 20 for each reference. We determined the contamination ratio by calculating the ratio of all reads with a mapping quality > = 20 for each reference, compared to those for the human CRS.",
            "PCR duplicates were marked and removed from unmerged reads using Picard tools 1.92 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), and from merged reads using a python script developed by Fu et al. [21]. MapDamage (v2.0.2\u20139) [22] was used to identify characteristic aDNA damage patterns, with the \u2018-rescale\u2019 option to lower the quality score of likely damaged sites. Thiamines (T) found at the 5\u2019end of a read and guanines (G) found at the 3\u2019 ends within the first two bases were rescaled to 0 for their quality scores. Modern human contamination levels were assessed using the ContamMix package with a set of 311 representative modern human mtDNA sequences [23].",
            "Variant call files (VCFs) were generated for all reads that mapped to the human reference genome using the GATK Haplotype Caller (v3.5) [24] with settings specific for haploid genomes and were filtered for mapping quality (<20) and bases that were covered by fewer than 3 reads. We only analysed sequences having a minimum of 96% coverage. VCF files were converted to whole-sequence FASTA files using in-house commands and GATK\u2019s FastaAlternateReferenceMaker. Coverage plots were created for all reads using R software [25], and plots of fragment length were created from merged reads with Picard\u2019s CollectInsertSizeMetrics (Picard tools 1.92,http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Consensus sequences were created (including indels) and these were deposited in GenBank. Sequences were assigned to haplogroup using Haplogrep [26] with Phylotree build 17. All reads generated have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRP123440), identified by lab sample number.",

            "Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was used to investigate clustering of related individuals. DAPC is a multivariate analysis used to extract information of genetic relationships for between- and within-species/population sequence data [28]. The DAPC approach is integrated into the R packageadegenet[29]. We used thefasta2DNAbinfunction provided byadegenetto load the sequence data into R. We then transformed the data to a genind file using DNAbin2genind (DAPC input format). The principal components (PC) and discriminant functions to retain were chosen using the plots created by the DAPC function (dapc).

            "The results of the tests for contamination from laboratory reagents indicated that very few reads mapped to any of the possible reagent contaminators of cow, pig, dog or chicken. The results of the assessment of the contamination from modern human DNA using the program ContamMix also indicate minimal modern contamination and are shown inS3 Table.",
            "From the 16 ancient Lebanese samples processed, a total of four complete ancient mitogenomes from three archaeological sites were considered acceptable in terms of their coverage (at least 3x), and showing appropriate damage patterns and no significant level of contamination, resulting in a success rate of 25%. From Monte Sirai, Sardinia, 10 complete mitogenomes were generated from the 12 samples processed, resulting in a success rate of 83%. This difference in success rates between the two regions is likely related to several factors impacting DNA preservation including temperature, humidity and post-excavation treatment [32]. Of the four Lebanese samples for which we were able to obtain acceptable full mitogenomes, one was from Tel Fadous-Kfarabida, one from BEY 197 and two were from BEY 198. All three of these sites were excavated in the last decade. The Lebanese samples were not washed in the field or lab, but they were not collected or stored specifically with the intention of future aDNA analyses. The soils from the Saifi site appeared to be moist, which may explain the poor results (0/4) from that site. Previous attempts to recover aDNA results from samples from a wet part of site BEY 198 (next to a well) were all unsuccessful (unpublished data). The Monte Sirai samples were all recently (2015) excavated and collected with the expressed purpose of aDNA analysis. Most of the graves were pits dug into the tuff (natural rock soil) that were closed, covered by stone slabs, and one sample, MS10584, was from a jar burial (enchytrismoi). These features may have provided protection from the elements resulting in better DNA preservation.",
            "The median average read depth across the mitochondrial genome for the 14 ancient samples was 22.7 (S2 Fig). Sardinian samples had a much wider range of coverage (range of mean coverage was 4.8 to 1321.2, while the range for Lebanese samples was 4.8 to 49.8). However, the amplicon length between the two groups was not significantly different (Welch two-sample t-test, t = 0.05, df = 5.42, p = 0.96) (S3 Fig). Damage patterns were consistent with those expected from aDNA [33] for all samples included in analyses (S4 Fig).",

            "We aimed to identify regionally informative mtDNA haplogroups to use as indicators of historical Phoenician ancestry. Populations that diverged from one-another carry uniparental lineages that accumulate mutations randomly, yielding increasing genetic distances between those populations. The induced geographic correlation with genetic distance will be visible using median-joining network techniques [34], and in the distance information contained in the ancestrally-informative components [35,36] in the singular value decomposition [37] of SNP data. Interpretation is subject to the caveat that principal component analysis identifies any leading alignments marking the largest distances among samples; connection to migrations requires care [38]. Statistics measuring the discriminating power of principal components between populations, such as DAPC [28], serve to test the isolation between populations. The strongest signals differentiating these populations will tend to be the oldest, since these yield the largest genetic differences.",

We only found one haplotype (H3) shared between pre-Phoenician and Phoenician era samples from Sardinia and this can be seen in the network analysis (Fig 2A). However, we do not find many mutations separating haplotypes from all the three groups, particularly those in haplogroup H. Two clades (the K1 and U5 haplogroups) contain samples from pre-Phoenician Sardinians only, whereas the W5, N1b1a5 and X2b clades contain only Phoenician Sardinians, and appear to be distant from any pre-Phoenician Sardinian samples and thus we suggest that these are likely Phoenician samples. The T2b3 sample from Beirut is only two mutations removed from a pre-Phoenician Sardinian sample and does not appear to be an indigenous Lebanese lineage but rather a foreign introduction to the Beirut Phoenician population. We carried out DAPC analyses to investigate genetic structuring within our sampling. DAPC performs discriminant analyses (DA) on principle components (PC). Generally, DA resolves between population relationships while ignoring within population variation [28]. DAPC uses PCA to resolve within population variation and then performs a DA to resolve between population structure [28]. The two DAPC plots (one discriminant function and two discriminant functions) support the pattern found in the network analysis, identifying overlapping signatures of Lebanese samples with the Sardinian Phoenicians, with a clear pre-Phoenician component of the population (Fig 2B and 2C). We see that most Phoenician-era samples cluster closely together with pre-Phoenician samples.",

            "The archaeological interpretation of the group burials in Monte Sirai is that they could represent family burials. We found that one group burial, containing four individuals, included two 6 to 12-year-olds who had near-identical J1c haplotypes (seeS3 Table). MS10579 and MS10580 were identified as J1c with SNPs at positions 16261 and 189. They also shared two novel mutations, 310.1C and 7154G. The remaining differences between these two haplotypes are four C to T transitions in sample MS10579, which are very likely to be the result of damage, and two missing SNPs which are due to reduced coverage in this region. It is therefore possible that these two were indeed siblings or otherwise maternally related, for example, cousins. The other two burials in that group had the two non-local lineages: another 6 to 12-year-old with the N1b1a5 and a young adult female, 16 to 22 years of age, with the W5 haplotype. While this indicates that there is not a maternal connection between these four individuals who were buried together, it is possible that they are family members related through paternal connections. The other group burial contained two individuals, an 8 to 14-year-old with an X2b haplotype and a young adult male with an H1bn mitogenome. Analyses of more burials from Monte Sirai and possible extended analyses of Y chromosome or autosomal data are necessary to further test the relatedness of individuals buried in Monte Sirai.",
            "The aim of the study was to seek mitochondrial DNA markers recovered from ancient samples that can be associated with Phoenician origins and ancestry, enabling us to track Phoenician mobility and genetic impacts of settlement, in this case, in Sardinia. We collected ancient samples from documented Middle Bronze Age and Phoenician burials in Lebanon, and from Monte Sirai, Sardinia, one of the largest Phoenician-Punic necropoli in the central Mediterranean.",
            "Without ancient DNA, a Phoenician introduced signature can be difficult to distinguish from earlier Near Eastern lineages that spread during the Neolithic expansion to European sites that were later colonized by the Phoenicians, like Monte Sirai. It is expected however, that Neolithic expansions would spread lineages broadly across the landscape, where Phoenician signatures are likely to be restricted to locations of well-established Phoenician contact [5]. Due to the relative isolation of Sardinia and the unusual genetic signature of its population, modern Sardinians are often presented as the best representation of the early Neolithic population that expanded from the Near East into Southern Europe [40,41]. The recent study of Olivieri et al. [15], which provides mitogenomes for 21 ancient samples and over 2000 new modern Sardinian samples, identifies numerous Sardinian-specific haplogroups including a few lineages they argue are likely indicative of pre-Neolithic settlement of the island. Their ancient samples date to between 6000 and 3000 years calBP and thus provide a valuable snapshot of the pre-Phoenician population of Sardinia.",
            "While the later Phoenician influence in Sardinia was likely via Carthage, as indicated by the archaeological evidence from Monte Sirai [13,14], we still might expect to see the appearance of new Near Eastern and/or North African mitochondrial lineages in the burials from the site given that Carthage was settled directly from Tyre. The appearance of Phoenician introduced markers in Sardinia might also be inferred by analyses of the estimated TMRCAs of shared haplogroups in modern populations in Lebanon and Sardinia that potentially differentiate them from older Neolithic signatures spread throughout Europe.",
            "The most common haplogroup seen in our ancient Lebanese and Sardinian samples was the superhaplogroup H, identified in 7 of 14 samples (50%). Two of the four ancient Lebanese samples belong to haplogroup H (sub-groups H and H34) and a third belongs to the sister clade, R0. Five of the Monte Sirai samples (50%) were identified as having H haplotypes (H+16311, H1e1a6, H1bn, H3, and H5d). Haplogroups H1, H3 and H5 are all thought to have a Southwest European origin and to have spread from there after the LGM [42]. There were no shared haplotypes between the ancient samples of Lebanon and those from Monte Sirai. However, all sequences belonging to haplogroups H and R0 (ancient samples of Lebanon and Sardinia, and Monte Sirai) are very closely related as they are separated by only few mutations (Fig 2A). Olivieri et al. [15] also report high levels of H subgroups in their ancient samples (38%) with several closely related lineages to our Monte Sirai samples (HV0j1, H1, H1e1, H1e1a, H3, H3u and H5a).",
            "In modern populations, the frequencies of haplogroup H range between 40\u201350% in Europe and about 20% in Southwest Asia. Subclades H1 and H3, the major subclades of this haplogroup, are almost exclusively European with limited penetration of H1 in the Near East, suggesting a European origin with estimated ages of 14Ky-16Ky and 9Ky-11Ky respectively [43]. Haplogroups H1 and H3 are the most common found in modern Sardinians, with several Sardinian specific lineages recently identified [15]. No H3 lineages were found in our ancient or modern Lebanese samples. Its presence in Sardinia in ancient samples (both pre-Phoenician and Phoenician), combined with the diversity seen in the modern Sardinian population is consistent with at least a Neolithic introduction to the island if not pre-Neolithic [15]. Haplogroup HV is also an ancient European lineage, likely originating in the Mediterranean region during the LGM and has been identified in early Neolithic remains from Spain [44]. However, to date, most studies on haplogroup H and its subgroups reveal a very complex tree structure and more mitogenome data is needed before any conclusion can be made with certainty about the origin and date of the H subgroups [45].",
            "Two samples from Monte Sirai (MS10579 and MS10580) have J1c haplotypes with the addition of two previously identified mutations at positions 189 and 16261 and a unique mutation at 7154. This full motif was not found in any of our modern Lebanese samples, though we did find a J1c with the 16261 mutation, and one J1c11a haplotype. Several J1c sub-types are seen in modern Sardinians and a J1c3 was identified in one pre-Phoenician sample dating to around 4000 BCE [15]. Haplogroup J is thought to have arisen in West Asia sometime around 45 Ky Pala et al. [46] suggest that during the LGM, haplogroup J sub-groups arose in the Near Eastern refugia, though since J1c is rare in the Near East today, it may have first emerged in southeast Europe. A J2b1 haplogroup was recently identified in an early Mesolithic (8227\u20137596 BCE) sample from Sardinia [47]. J1c has not yet been found in any ancient Mesolithic samples in Europe, but Mathieson et al. [48] have reported J1c haplotypes in samples from Turkey, Hungary and Germany dating from 4000 BCE and in Spain from 2000 BCE. Allentoft et al. [49] found a J1c1b in a Bronze Age sample from Italy. It is clear that J1c was present in Sardinia prior to the arrival of Phoenicians, and possibly prior to Neolithic expansions.",
            "The presence of one sample from Monte Sirai, MS10578, a 6 to 12-year-old child that has an N1b1a5 haplotype is of particular interest. Haplogroup N lineages are rare in modern Sardinians. Recently, however, four individuals were identified carrying haplogroup N1b1a9, which appears to be a Sardinian specific haplogroup [15]. The coalescence ages of this haplogroup are estimated to be 7.3\u20139.4 Ky, so this may have been a pre-Neolithic introduction to the island. N1b1a5, however, is more recent (Olivieri et al. [15]Fig 3), dating to 2.5 Ky, which aligns nicely with a Phoenician/Punic introduction. Brandt et al. [45] suggest that N is a marker of Western European Hunter Gatherers as it has been found in Mesolithic samples from Portugal and a Palaeolithic sample in Southern Italy. Ancient samples with haplogroup N1a have been found in early Neolithic sites from Spain and Germany [41], but N1b has not been recorded in Neolithic samples outside of the Levant with two exceptions from Anatolia dating to 6500\u20136200 BCE [48,50] and between 7500\u20135800 calBCE [51]. N1b is a relatively common haplogroup in Lebanon, with 9 of the 87 (10%) modern samples we sequenced carrying N1b1a subtypes. While we have not found any N1b in our ancient Lebanese samples, it is not unlikely that this haplogroup was introduced to Sardinia via Phoenician contact, either directly from the Levant or via Phoenician/Punic settlements in North Africa, for example Carthage.Fig 3Ashows that N1b1a lineages have been identified in modern Tunisians [52,53] and in a modern Moroccan [52], as well as in a modern individual from Sicily, another island with known Phoenician settlement [54].",
            "Haplogroup W is thought to have evolved during the LGM around the Caspian Sea region. Its oldest subgroup, W1 has been found in one individual from the Neolithic site of Barc\u0131n, in Anatolia dating to 6500\u20136200 BCE. Haplogroups W1, W3 and W6 have been found in late Neolithic and early Bronze Age sites in Germany and Russia [48] and W1 has been identified in a Neolithic sample from the Iberian Peninsula [55]. W5 has yet to be identified in Mesolithic or Neolithic remains in Europe or in any ancient samples from the Levant [48,50]. While haplogroups W1, W3 and W10 are present in modern Sardinians [15], the archaeological sample from Monte Sirai, MS10581, a young female included in a group burial, is, as far as we know, the first W5 identified in Sardinia. The age of W5 has been estimated to be 12.2 Ky [56], and while W5 is most commonly found in Northern Central Europe and Britain today (Fig 3B), a basal W5 lineage was identified in a Moroccan Berber [56], which clusters most closely with our Phoenician sample. Our ancient result from Monte Sirai is indeed significant and establishes a minimum date of late 5thcentury BCE for haplogroup W5 in the Mediterranean region and, given the Phoenician trade networks, could explain the presence of W5 in North Africa. It is possible that haplogroup W5 got into the Mediterranean via the Phoenician tin trade with Britain or Ireland, though only further aDNA work can confirm this hypothesis.",
            "Sample MS10587 from Monte Sirai belonged to haplogroup X2b, with an extra mutation at position 226C. Mathiesen et al. [48] report this same signature in a sample (I1499) from Garadna, Hungary dating to 5210\u20135010 calBCE (seeS5 Fig). X2b has also been recorded in an early Neolithic sample from Revenia, Greece, dated to 6438\u20136264 calBCE [57]. Haplogroup X is relatively rare in Europe, generally found at frequencies of less than 1%. The highest frequencies of X in Europe are reported in Catalonia, the Pyrenees and southern Portugal, at about 2.5%. It is found at relatively high frequencies in Druze from the Levant, where it reaches frequencies of up to 15%, including subtype X2b (Fig 3C), though we did not identify X haplotypes in any of our modern Lebanese samples. It is possible that X2b was a Phoenician haplogroup introduced to Sardinia either directly from Lebanon or via North Africa, though an earlier, early Neolithic introduction, perhaps via a maritime route [58] cannot be rejected. However, haplogroup X was not found in any of the 21 ancient Sardinian samples reported by Olivieri et al. [15].",
            "Sample MS10560, from BEY 197, was identified as a T2b3 with an additional mutation at position 151. T2b is a haplogroup that we did not identify in any of the modern Lebanese we sequenced though T2 is found at low frequencies there today and was identified in one of our modern Lebanese samples. Haplogroup T2 is currently found at around 10% frequency in northern and central Europe, though some of the highest rates are in Sardinia, southern Portugal and pockets in northern Spain. T2b is the most common T2 subgroup found in Europe today and it has been identified in ancient samples from the LBK in central Europe. Haplogroup T2c is reported in an early Neolithic sample (5295\u20135066 calBCE) from the Els Trocs site in the Pyrenees [48]. There has been some debate regarding the origins of the T2 lineages, which were originally thought to have had a Near East origin and spread into Europe with Neolithic expansions. To date, in the ancient Near East, T2b has only been identified in two Neolithic samples from north-western Anatolia, dated to around 6500BCE [48]. It has not been found in 45 samples tested from Israel, Jordan and Iran, dating from the Natufian through the Early Bronze Age [40] or in 15 Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) samples from Syria [58], or 9 PPN samples from central Anatolia [51]. It is possible that the origins of T2 and in particular T2b may indeed be in southern Central Europe in the LGM, as suggested by Pala et al. [46].",
            "Finally, the presence of a T2b3 haplotype in an ancient sample from Lebanon is unusual, as it does not appear to be an indigenous lineage. The tomb in which the burial was found was not marked and did not have any of the artefacts found in site 198, suggesting different burial customs. This is further evidence suggesting that this individual belonged to a different socioeconomic class or ethnic group, perhaps a slave brought to Beirut from one of the Phoenician settlements. Of particular interest is the reporting of a T2b3 with the 151 mutation (plus one more mutation at position 9926) in an ancient sample (KY399146) reported by Olivieri et al. [15] dating to 3086 \u00b1 85 calBP from Cagliari, Sardinia. Cagliari was the site of another significant Phoenician colony, Karaly. Our ancient Beirut sample is most closely related to modern samples from Tunisia (Fig 3D), again, possibly indicating movement of women through the Phoenician networks from European colonies and trading ports to Phoenician cities in the homeland and Carthage.",
            "Olivieri et al. [15] suggest that their analyses of Sardinian-Specific Haplogroups and ancient mitogenomes dating to between 6000 and 3000 years ago may indicate that the earliest inhabitants of the island arrived prior to the Neolithic expansion into the region, which is consistent with archaeological and Y-chromosome data suggesting earlier settlement [59\u201362]. In particular, they identify haplogroups K1a2d and U5b1i1 as likely Mesolithic arrivals in Sardinia, but also raise the possibility that several H1 and H3 subgroups found in modern Sardinians are pre-Neolithic. While we found several H lineages in our ancient Phoenicians, including a shared H3 haplotype with an ancient pre-Phoenician Sardinian sample, we found no evidence of K1 or U5 lineages in the Monte Sirai samples. Recent analyses of 3514 whole-genome sequences of modern Sardinians [63] suggest pre-Neolithic occupation of the island and that some of the populations, particularly those in the mountainous central eastern (Gennargentu) region of the island, carry higher levels of this hunter-gatherer DNA compared to populations from more accessible regions. Our result, finding no K1 or U5 mitochondrial lineages in Monte Sirai, may be indicative of early social and/or geographic isolation of those hunter-gatherer populations.",
            "The proposed Phoenician lineages, W5, N1b1a5 and X2b are not found in Sardinians today, suggesting rare introductions, of the nature of single individuals rather than as representative of major colonizing groups. We suggest that N1b1a5 could be an introduction from Carthage or some other North African location within the Phoenician network. It is therefore interesting that Chiang et al. [63] do find evidence in the whole-genome data of a small degree of what they suggest may be either sub-Saharan ancestry or North African ancestry prior to the Arab expansions, which they indicate could indeed be related to Phoenician contact.",
            "Our analyses of ancient pre-Phoenician and Phoenician mitogenomes from Lebanon and Sardinia provide important clues on cultural expansion, assimilation and population mobility in the Mediterranean between the 5thand 3rdcenturies BCE. First, we see a certain degree of continuity of population ancestry between Phoenician and pre-Phoenician populations in Sardinia, which is consistent with archaeological evidence of integration between the cultures [64,65]. However, our data from Monte Sirai, combined with our previously published result identifying a European mitochondrial haplogroup, U5b2c1, in a young man buried in a Phoenician crypt in Carthage, North Africa [17], provide evidence of several instances of unexpected, non-indigenous mitochondrial haplotypes in Phoenician burials both in and outside the homeland of Lebanon. These include the T2b3 haplotype in the BEY 197 site, Beirut, Lebanon, and the Near Eastern N1b1a5 and a northern European W5 found in Monte Sirai, Sardinia. Sardinia has been the subject of numerous genetic studies due to its important geographic isolation. The Sardinian population is often described as the best representation of early farmer ancestry [40,41], and indeed, we do see the likely early farmer mtDNA lineages combined with those of the Southwestern/Central Mediterranean Mesolithic (particularly haplogroups H and possibly H1, H3 and H5), in the Phoenician samples at Monte Sirai. Brandt et al. [45] highlight the need for more aDNA complete mitogenomes to interpret the variation within Haplogroup H in the past and to assign specific subtypes to particular regions and time periods. The seven ancient Phoenician H samples identified here can help contribute to that goal. However, we also see haplogroups that indicate other influences in the population history of Sardinia, with the appearance of N1b1a5 and W5, which have not yet been recorded in modern Sardinian populations. These two haplogroups and possibly X2b, we suggest, are examples of Phoenician introductions to Sardinia, not only from the Phoenician homeland or via Punic settlements in North Africa, but may represent the mobility of women through the wider Phoenician trade networks.",
            "While previous Y chromosome analyses of modern populations around the Mediterranean demonstrated the impact of Phoenician males on the genetic makeup of many communities [5], we now see that it is likely that the Phoenician trade networks or settlements strategies also included the translocation of women throughout the region as well as the assimilation of indigenous women in Phoenician settlements. Analyses of genetic variation in modern Lebanese populations [6] suggest closer affiliations with Europe based on mitochondrial lineages. Our result, identifying the European lineage T2b3 in the BEY197 site, suggests that some of those European mtDNA lineages could be associated with the integration of European women in Phoenician communities in Lebanon.",
            "Finally, numerous studies published in the last five years highlight the importance of aDNA studies in understanding population change through time, though most of these have focused on the Neolithic transition. While these studies tell a story of significant population replacement in Europe with the arrival of farmers, analyses of later historic burials associated with Roman Britain [66], for example, and now our data from Phoenician sites, demonstrate that both migration and cultural assimilation were common, resulting in surprisingly cosmopolitan communities in the past.",

            "While the series of events that shaped the transition between foraging societies and food producers are well described for Central and Southern Europe, genetic evidence from Northern Europe surrounding the Baltic Sea is still sparse. Here, we report genome-wide DNA data from 38 ancient North Europeans ranging from ~9500 to 2200 years before present. Our analysis provides genetic evidence that hunter-gatherers settled Scandinavia via two routes. We reveal that the first Scandinavian farmers derive their ancestry from Anatolia 1000 years earlier than previously demonstrated. The range of Mesolithic Western hunter-gatherers extended to the east of the Baltic Sea, where these populations persisted without gene-flow from Central European farmers during the Early and Middle Neolithic. The arrival of steppe pastoralists in the Late Neolithic introduced a major shift in economy and mediated the spread of a new ancestry associated with the Corded Ware Complex in Northern Europe.",
            "The population history of Europe is complex and its very north has not yet been comprehensively studied at a genetic level. Here, Mittnik et al. report genome-wide data from 38 ancient individuals from the Eastern Baltic, Russia and Scandinavia to analyse gene flow throughout the Mesolithic and Bronze Age.",

However, the archaeological record of the very north of the European subcontinent surrounding today\u2019s Baltic Sea shows a history distinct to that of Central and Southern Europe which has not yet been comprehensively studied on a genomic level.",
            "Settlement of the Eastern Baltic and Scandinavia by mobile foragers started after the retreat of the glacial ice sheets around 11,000 years before present9. To the west and south, hunter-gatherers sharing a common genetic signature (Western Hunter-Gatherers or WHG; Supplementary Note1provides a glossary of abbreviations and archaeological terms) already occupied wide ranges of Europe for several millennia1,2,5,10,11. From further to the east, in the territory of today\u2019s Russia, remains of Mesolithic foragers have been studied (Eastern Hunter-Gatherers or EHG)2,4. They derived part of their ancestry, referred to as Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) ancestry, from a population related to the Upper Palaeolithic Mal\u2019ta boy found in Siberia (MA1)6,12. Late Mesolithic foragers excavated in central Sweden, which have been called Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHG)1,2, were modelled as admixed between WHG and EHG6. Archaeological evidence for the settlement of Scandinavia suggests both a route through southern Scandinavia and a route along the northern coast of Fennoscandia13. Foraging groups that inhabited the eastern coast and larger islands of the Baltic Sea as well as the Eastern Baltic inland during the 8th and 7th millennium calibrated radiocarbon years before Common Era (calBCE) developed a dual habitation system, establishing more permanent settlements than their surrounding contemporaries while remaining partially mobile14,15.",
            "The following Early Neolithic period, starting around 6000 calBCE, saw the transition from foraging to a sedentary agricultural lifestyle with the expansion of farmers out of Anatolia into Central and Southern Europe1,4,6,16,17. This development reached southern Scandinavia at around 4000 calBCE with farmers of the so-called Early Neolithic Funnel Beaker Culture (EN TRB; from GermanTrichterbecher) who gradually introduced cultivation of cereals and cattle rearing. At the transition to the northern Middle Neolithic, around 3300 calBCE, an intensification of agriculture occurred in Denmark and in western central Sweden accompanied by the erection of megaliths. Settlements in eastern central Sweden increasingly concentrated along the coast, where the economy shifted towards the marine resources. Early pottery of these coastal hunter-gatherers, known as the Pitted Ware Culture (PWC), resembles the Funnel beakers in shape. Analysis of ancient genomes from PWC and megalithic Middle Neolithic TRB (MN TRB) context in central Sweden has shown that the PWC individuals retain the genetic signature of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers while the TRB farmers\u2019 ancestry can mainly be traced back to Central European farmers, albeit with substantial admixture from European hunter-gatherers18\u201320. As these TRB individuals date to a period one millennium after the initial Neolithization in southern Scandinavia, the question remains whether the first introduction of farming around 4000 BCE was driven by newcomers or by local groups involving later gene-flow from Central European farmers.",
            "The production and use of pottery, in Central and Southern Europe often seen as part of the \u2018Neolithic package\u2019, was already common among foragers in Scandinavia during the preceding Mesolithic Erteb\u00f8lle phase. Similarly, in the Eastern Baltic, where foraging continued to be the main form of subsistence until at least 4000 calBCE15, ceramics technology was adopted before agriculture, as seen in the Narva Culture and Combed Ceramic Culture (CCC). Recent genome-wide data of Baltic pottery-producing hunter-gatherers revealed genetic continuity with the preceding Mesolithic inhabitants of the same region as well as influence from the more northern EHG21,22, but did not reveal conclusively whether there was a temporal, geographical or cultural correlation with the affinity to either WHG or EHG.",
            "The transition from the Late (Final) Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age (LNBA) is seen as a major transformative period in European prehistory, accompanied by changes in burial customs, technology and mode of subsistence as well as the creation of new cross-continental networks of contact seen in the emergence of the pan-European Corded Ware Complex (CWC, ca. 2900\u20132300 calBCE) in Central2and north-eastern Europe21. Studies of ancient genomes have shown that those associated with the CWC were closely related to the pastoralists of the Yamnaya Culture from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, introducing a genetic component that was not present in Europe previously2,3. This genetic component is hypothesized to have spread in the subsequent millennia throughout Europe and can be seen in today\u2019s European populations in a decreasing north-east to south-west gradient.",
            "Intriguingly, modern Eastern Baltic populations carry the highest proportion of WHG ancestry of all Europeans1, supporting the theory that the hunter-gatherer population of this region left a lasting genetic impact on subsequent populations23.",
            "Here, we investigate the modes of cultural and economic transitions experienced by the prehistoric populations surrounding the Baltic Sea. Were the changes seen in the Eastern Baltic Neolithic, which did not involve the introduction of agriculture, driven by contact with neighbouring groups and if so can we identify these? Was the earliest practice of farming in southern Scandinavia a development by a local population or did it involve migration from the South? How did the unique genetic signature of modern Eastern Baltic populations come to be?",
            "We present novel genome-wide data from 38 ancient individuals from the Eastern Baltic, Russia and Sweden spanning 7000 years of prehistory, covering the transition from a mobile hunter-gatherer to a sedentary agricultural lifestyle, as well as the adoption of bronze metallurgy. We show that the settlement of Scandinavia by hunter-gatherers likely took place via at least two routes, and that the first introduction of farming was brought about by the movement of the Central European farmers into the region at around 4000 calBCE. In the Eastern Baltics, foraging remained the dominant economy among interconnected north-eastern hunter-gatherer groups that did not experience admixture from European farmers until around 3000 calBCE, when a shift towards agro-pastoralism came about through migrations from the Pontic-Caspian steppe.",

In principle, it is possible that such a pattern is not the result of admixture but a signal of a long-standing geographic cline. However, in this case, it appears to be more compatible with recent admixture between differentially WHG- and EHG-related groups, as we see varying ancestry proportions even within contemporary individuals from the same site or closely located sites (Fig.3).D-statistics of the formD(Baltic EMN Narva, WHG;X, Mbuti) do not show evidence of admixture with the contemporaneous European farming populations that were related to the Anatolian Neolithic (Supplementary Tables2and5).

            "The substantial population movement at the beginning of the 3rd millennium calBCE, during the European LNBA, affected the genetic makeup of Eastern and Central Europe and Scandinavia2,3. It also made its mark in the Eastern Baltic region, as seen in our five samples from Lithuania and Estonia dated to this period and the previously published individuals from the Eastern Baltic region21,22. All Baltic LN individuals (ca. 3200\u20131750 calBCE) fall in PCA space in the diffuse European LNBA cluster formed by individuals admixed between Early and Middle Bronze Age pastoralists from the Yamnaya culture of the eastern Pontic Steppe and Middle Neolithic European farmers (Fig.2a). They all carry the genetic component that was introduced into Europe with this pastoralist migration in varying amounts, and the majority also carries the component associated with Anatolian farmers (green and orange, respectively, in Fig.2b). This genetic impact is furthermore reflected in the uniparental markers where we see novel mitochondrial haplogroups (I, J, T2, W), not found in the preceding foragers, in half of our samples (Supplementary Fig.5), and I2a Y-chromosomal haplogroups replaced by R1a types (Table1, Supplementary Note3).",

Younger individuals share more alleles with Anatolian and European farmers (Supplementary Table7) as also observed in contemporaneous Central European CWC individuals2. The individual Spiginas230, dated to a very late period of the LN (2130\u20131750 calBCE), stands out in that it shares an excess of alleles with European forager groups when compared to the Yamnaya populations, with the top hits being Switzerland_HG, WHG, Baltic Mesolithic and Baltic EMN Narva (Supplementary Table7).",
            "This result is the earliest evidence for a continuing pattern: we observe that the increased affinity to Baltic hunter-gatherers remains prevalent in the more recent samples from the Baltic BA (dated between ca. 1000 and 230 calBCE) that cluster together on the PCA in the same space occupied by modern Lithuanians and Estonians, shifted from other Europeans to WHG and Baltic hunter-gatherers (Fig.2a). The statisticD(Baltic BA, Baltic LN; Baltic EMN Narva, Mbuti) is strongly significant (Z=\u200914.0; Supplementary Table2) demonstrating the increase in allele sharing with local hunter-gatherers in the Baltic populations after the Late Neolithic. Replacing Baltic EMN Narva with the contemporaneous northern population of Baltic MN CCC does not yield significant results, suggesting that admixture with this population did not play a large role in the ancestry of our studied Bronze Age individuals. Additionally,D-statistics provide significantly positive results forD(Baltic BA, Baltic LN;X, Mbuti) whenXwas replaced by various agricultural populations of Europe and the Near East (Supplementary Table2), which suggests that the formation of the Baltic BA gene pool was not completed by admixture between the Baltic LN population and foragers but involved additional gene-flow from outside the Baltic territory. Archaeological evidence supports that the site Kivutkalns, which is represented by 10 of our individuals, was a major bronze-working centre located on a trade route that opened to the Baltic Sea on the west and led inland following the Daugava river31, where contact to surrounding populations might have been common.",

This provides genomic evidence for the influence of both the early Neolithic and LNBA expansions having reached as far as northern Sweden in the 3rd millennium calBCE, either through a northward expansion from southern Scandinavia or across the Baltic Sea by boat or over the frozen sea33. Assemblages similar to the early Battle Axe Culture of Sweden have been found in south-western Finland, across the Bothnian Sea34,35which could be considered a geographically closer source than southern Scandinavia.",

The statisticD(Lithuanian, Baltic BA;X, Mbuti) reveals significantly positive results for many modern Near Eastern and Southern European populations (Supplementary Fig.6a). Limited gene-flow from more south-western neighbouring regions after the Bronze Age is sufficient to explain this pattern, as nearly all modern populations besides Estonians, especially for Central and Western Europe, have a higher amount of farmer ancestry than Lithuanians.",

            "The Mesolithic SHG excavated at Motala, Sweden, owe their genetic signature to an admixture of WHG and EHG and similarly to the latter carry substantial ANE ancestry. In contrast, the two Eastern Baltic Mesolithic Kunda individuals, who predate the SHG, carry comparatively low proportions of ANE ancestry, indicating that this ancestry was never widespread to the southeast of the Baltic Sea and likely reached Scandinavia without traversing the Eastern Baltic. This provides indirect support to the archaeological evidence that Scandinavia was settled by two routes13, suggesting a scenario in which the ANE-related ancestry was brought into Scandinavia with a movement of people via a north-eastern coastal route, where they admixed with a WHG-like population that derived from a migration over the land-bridge that connected Denmark and southern Sweden at the time.\u00a0This scenario is also supported by the finding that\u00a0three Mesolithic hunter-gatherers excavated at the coast of Norway carry\u00a0a higher\u00a0proportion of EHG ancestry compared to the individuals from\u00a0inland\u00a0Sweden37.",
            "In southern Scandinavia, the sequence of events resembles that seen in Central Europe, albeit several millennia later, in that the earliest agriculture in the region coincides with the appearance of people related to the Anatolian and European Neolithic. However, similar to Middle Neolithic Central and Southern European populations, early Scandinavian farmers are already strongly admixed with hunter-gatherer groups. Without the knowledge of the genetic substrate in Mesolithic southern Scandinavia, these results are consistent with different scenarios; e.g. a movement of a Central European population into southern Scandinavia without admixture with local SHG-like populations, or local admixture of LBK-like farmers with a forager population that shows more similarity to WHG or Baltic hunter-gatherers19. A detailed joint analysis of genetic and archaeological data from hunter-gatherers from northern Germany, Denmark and the southern tip of Sweden is necessary to establish the role of local admixture during the emergence of the TRB culture. Our data support that the Neolithic PWC foragers are largely genetically continuous to SHG, which is congruent with their similarities in subsistence strategies, while continuity between EN TRB and PWC can also be seen in archaeological assemblages38and can be attributed to contact between farmers and foragers. Indeed, genetic evidence of admixture between these groups shows that they were not completely isolated from each other but did likely not uphold continuous contact nor intermarry frequently during their prolonged parallel existence in Scandinavia.",
            "In the archaeological understanding, the transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic in the Eastern Baltic region does not coincide with a large-scale population turnover and a stark shift in economy as seen in Central and Southern Europe. Rather, it is signified by a change in networks of contacts and the use of pottery, among other material, cultural and economic changes15. Our results suggest continued admixture between groups in the south of the Eastern Baltic region, who are more closely related to WHG, and northern or eastern groups, more closely related to EHG. Neolithic social networks from the Eastern Baltic to the River Volga could also explain similarities of the hunter-gatherer pottery styles, although morphologically analogous ceramics might also have developed independently due to similar functionality39. The genetic evidence for a change in networks and possibly even a large-scale population movement is most pronounced in the Middle Neolithic in individuals attributed to the CCC. The distribution of this culture overlaps in the north with the Narva culture and extends further north to Finland and Karelia. Its spread in the Eastern Baltic is linked with a significant change in imported raw materials, artefacts, and the appearance of village-like settlements15.",
            "We see a further population movement into the regions surrounding the Baltic Sea with the CWC in the Late Neolithic that was accompanied by the first evidence of extensive animal husbandry in the Eastern Baltic15. The presence of ancestry from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe among Baltic CWC individuals without the genetic component from north-western Anatolian Neolithic farmers must be due to a direct migration of steppe pastoralists that did not pick up this ancestry in Central Europe. It suggests import of the new economy by an incoming steppe-like population independent of the agricultural societies that were already established to the south and west of the Baltic Sea. The presence of direct contacts to the steppe could lend support to a linguistic model that sees an early branching of Balto-Slavic from a Proto-Indo-European language, for which the west Eurasian steppe was proposed as a homeland40\u201342. However, as farmer ancestry is found in later Eastern Baltic individuals, it is likely that considerable individual mobility and a network of contact throughout the range of the CWC facilitated its spread eastward, possibly through exogamous marriage practices43. Conversely, the appearance of mitochondrial haplogroup U4 in the Central European Late Neolithic after millennia of absence44could indicate female gene-flow from the Eastern Baltic, where this haplogroup was present at high frequency.",
            "Local foraging societies were, however, not completely replaced and contributed a substantial proportion to the ancestry of Eastern Baltic individuals of the latest LN and Bronze Age. This \u2018resurgence\u2019 of hunter-gatherer ancestry in the local population through admixture between foraging and farming groups recalls the same phenomenon observed in the European Middle Neolithic2,45and is responsible for the unique genetic signature of modern-day Eastern Baltic populations.",
            "We suggest that the Siberian and East Asian related ancestry in Estonia, and Y-haplogroup N in north-eastern Europe, where it is widespread today, arrived there after the Bronze Age, ca. 500 calBCE, as we detect neither in our Bronze Age samples from Lithuania and Latvia. As Uralic speaking populations of the Volga-Ural region36show high frequencies of haplogroup N36, a connection was proposed with the spread of Uralic language speakers from the east that contributed to the male gene pool of Eastern Baltic populations and left linguistic descendants in the Finno-Ugric languages Finnish and Estonian46,47. A potential future direction of research is the identification of the proximate population that contributed to the arrival of this eastern ancestry into Northern Europe.",

            "Sampling was performed in the cleanroom facilities at the Institute for Archeological Sciences in T\u00fcbingen for the Eastern Baltic material, at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA for the Popovo sample, at the cleanroom facilities of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, for the samples from Olsund and Uzhni/Yuzhny Oleni Ostrov, and in the ancient DNA laboratory of the Archaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm, for the remaining Swedish material. The human remains were treated with ultraviolet (UV) light from all sides for 10\u2009min to reduce surface DNA contamination. Teeth were sawed transversally at the border of root and crown before sampling dentine powder from the inside of the crown with a sterile dentistry drill. Bone powder was taken from the inner parts of the bones with a sterile dentistry drill after removing the surface layer of the bone.",
            "Between 30 and 200\u2009mg of powder was used for each DNA extraction (Supplementary Data1, column M1). The extraction was performed following a silica-column-based protocol optimized for the recovery of small ancient DNA molecules48with use of the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit (Roche). Extraction buffer (0.45\u2009M EDTA, pH 8.0 (Life Technologies), 0.25\u2009mg/ml Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to the bone powder aliquot, and rotated overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The powder was then pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000\u2009rpm. The supernatant was added to 10\u2009ml binding buffer (5\u2009M GuHCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 40% Isopropanol (Merck)) with 400\u2009\u03bcg sodium acetate, pH 5.5 (Sigma-Aldrich) and mixed. The mixture was then transferred to the High Pure Extender Assembly funnel with a purification column attached and contained in a 50-ml Falcon tube. The tube was then spun at 1500\u2009rpm for at least 8\u2009min with slow acceleration until the binding buffer had mostly passed the purification column. Then the column was transferred into a new collection tube and the liquid remaining in the funnel was transferred to the column that was then centrifuged at 14,000\u2009rpm. This was followed by a wash step consisting of adding 450\u2009\u03bcl of wash buffer (supplied with the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit) to the column and spinning it at 8000\u2009rpm for 1\u2009min, the wash step is repeated and then followed by two dry spins at 14,000\u2009rpm for 1\u2009min. The DNA was eluted in a fresh siliconized Eppendorf tube in two elution steps of 50\u2009\u03bcl TET (1\u2009mM EDTA, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (AppliChem), 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) centrifuged for 1\u2009min at 14,000\u2009rpm, resulting in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DNA extract for each sample. Negative controls were taken along for each extraction setup.",
            "Double-stranded next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared from a 20-\u00b5l aliquot of extract following a protocol established for ancient DNA49. Negative controls were taken along for each library preparation setup. First, a blunt-ending step was performed by adding the template to a mix of 1\u00d7 NEB buffer 2 (NEB), 100\u2009\u00b5M dNTP mix (Thermo Scientific), 0.8\u2009mg/ml BSA (NEB), 0.4\u2009U/\u00b5l T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB), 0.024\u2009U/\u00b5l T4 Polymerase (NEB) and 1\u2009mM ATP (NEB) and incubating at 15\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min, then for 15\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C, followed by purification with the MinElute kit (QIAGEN) and elution in 18\u2009\u00b5l of TET. The following adapter ligation was performed by adding 1\u00d7 Quick Ligase Buffer (NEB), 250\u2009nM Illumina Adapters (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.125\u2009U/\u00b5l Quick Ligase (NEB) for a final reaction volume of 40\u2009\u00b5l. The mix was incubated for 20\u2009min at room temperature after which another MinElute purification was performed and the DNA is eluted in 20\u2009\u00b5l TET. The following fill-in step consisted of adding the 20\u2009\u00b5l DNA to 1\u00d7 Isothermal Buffer (NEB), 125\u2009nM dNTP mix (Thermo Scientific) and 0.4\u2009U/\u00b5l Bst Polymerase 2.0 (NEB) for a final reaction volume of 40. The mix was incubated for 20\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C and for 20\u2009min at 80\u2009\u00b0C. After the fill-in step, libraries were quantified via qPCR to ensure that the reactions were efficient. Some DNA extracts showed evidence of inhibition of enzymatic reactions, possibly due to the presence of humic acids or chemicals (glue or hardener) used for bone treatment50. To overcome inhibition, library preparation was repeated for samples that had a low DNA yield after initial library preparation or had abnormal extracts (e.g. dark colouring, floating particles, etc.) using 10-fold less extract as template to dilute the potential inhibiting factors.",

            "X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia is a heterogeneous nonprogressive neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in early childhood. We searched for a genetic cause of this condition, previously reported in a Buryat pedigree of Mongolian ancestry from southeastern Russia. Using whole-genome sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, we found a missense mutation in theABCB7(ABC-binding cassette transporter B7) gene, encoding a mitochondrial transporter, involved in heme synthesis and previously associated with sideroblastic anemia and ataxia. The mutation resulting in a substitution of a highly conserved glycine to serine in position 682 is apparently a major causative factor of the cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy found in affected individuals of a Buryat family who had no evidence of sideroblastic anemia. Moreover, in these affected men we also found the genetic defects in two other genes closely linked toABCB7on chromosome X: a deletion of a genomic region harboring the second exon of copper-transporter gene (ATP7A) and a complete deletion ofPGAM4(phosphoglycerate mutase family member 4) retrogene located in the intronic region of theATP7Agene. Despite the deletion, eliminating the first of six metal-binding domains inATP7A, no signs for Menkes disease or occipital horn syndrome associated withATP7Amutations were found in male carriers. The role of thePGAM4gene has been previously implicated in human reproduction, but our data indicate that its complete loss does not disrupt male fertility. Our finding links cerebellar pathology to the genetic defect inABCB7andATP7Astructural variant inherited as X-linked trait, and further reveals the genetic heterogeneity of X-linked cerebellar disorders.",
            "X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia is a heterogeneous nonprogressive disease that occurs generally in the first years of life and is characterized by developmental delay and difficulties in coordination owing to hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebellum. Most of the congenital cerebellar hypoplasia and atrophy cases, such as oligophrenin-1 syndrome (OMIM: 300486) or MICPCH/CASK syndrome (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (membrane-associated guanylate kinase family (MAGUK) family); OMIM: 300749), are considered to be X-chromosome-associated intellectual disability pathologies.1,2Loss of function of oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) gene leads to cerebellar hypoplasia and frontotemporal atrophy,1and to hippocampal alterations3by affecting Rho GTPase-dependent signaling required in cell migration and morphogenesis, synapse maturation and plasticity of neurons. Similarly, the dysfunction ofCASKgene, which encodes the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (MAGUK family), is associated with ataxia, mental retardation and microcephaly.2The cerebellar dysfunctions are also linked to ion exchange abnormalities. In one familial case, the cause of the disease was a Ca2+imbalance as a result of mutation in theATP2B3gene, an ATPase transmembrane transporter that moves Ca2+ions out of the cell against concentration gradients.4In another case, the X-linked spinocerebellar ataxia was linked to a nonsynonymous variant in theGJB1gene encoding protein connexin 32, which supports ions and transfer of small molecules by forming gap junction channels between cells.5Here, we report the case of inherited neurological pathology linked to genetic defects in genes for metal-ion transporters in a large Buryat pedigree (Figure 1).6",

We narrowed down the candidate-gene list by excludingNHSL2(Gene ID: 340527),AMER1(Gene ID: 139285),PHKA1(Gene ID: 5255) andRGAG1(Gene ID: 57529) based on evolutionary analysis, gene expression profiles in tissues and protein topology position (Supplementary Figure 1).NHSL2gene was excluded because there are no reports on association of rare variants in theNHSL2gene, including the rs72630038 (SCV000221324) (MAF=0.045 in 1000 Genomes Project Consortium15) found in the Buryat patient, with any disorder; low expression of the gene in the cerebellum at prenatal period;16,17and that at least one mammalian species (hedgehog) bears the same rare amino-acid variant inNHSL2. Mutations in theAMER1gene are known as genetic factors underlying osteopathia striata, cranial sclerosis and intellectual disability syndrome (OMIM: 300647 and 300373). We excludedAMER1gene because of the clinical phenotype differences in our patients and location of the variant (SCV000221323) in evolutionarily non-conserved region of the protein. Mutations in thePHKA1gene lead to X-linked muscle glycogenosis (OMIM: 311870 and OMIM 300559), which is also distant from the observed clinical symptoms in our patients. The amino-acid substitution arginine to glutamine (SCV000221325) in the PHKA1 protein occurred in non-conserved position. Variant inRGAG1(retrotransposon gag domain containing 1 protein) gene (SCV000221326) is also localized in a non-conserved position. Ultimately, we identified the genetic defects in two closely linked genes, both essential for metal transport. We found that the missense mutation in exon 16 of theABCB7(ABC-binding cassette transporter B7) gene (SCV000221289), which is in linkage disequilibrium with a large 41.4\u2009kb deletion in theATP7Agene on X-chromosome (SCV000221290) in this family, is the most probable causative factor for the neurological disease of the Buryat patients (Figure 2).",

As the identified variant is localized near an acceptor splice site within the first coding triplet of exon 16, we examined if the substitution could lead to the formation of a new strong splice site. The bioinformatic tools testing putative splicing sites based on nucleotide frequencies in each site position (from \u221220 to +3) for constitutive, cassette, inner acceptors and outer acceptors predicted no splicing alterations for the mutant allele18,19(Supplementary Table 5).",
            "There are several known transcripts ofABCB7gene encoding protein isoforms, and the identified variant affects all predicted protein isoforms. The structure and function of ABCB7 protein domains are not fully understood. The mutation is located in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of ABCB7 protein (NP_001258625, UniProtO75027), and disruption of this region in ATM1 yeast ortholog leads to the loss of protein function and iron accumulation inside the mitochondrion (Supplementary Figure 3A).20We studied structural alterations in the ABCB7 protein bearing mutant serine variant using the bioinformatics program Phyre2.21Comparative analysis of ~1000 paralogous and orthologous amino-acid sequences of superfamily ABC transporter proteins shows a highly conserved glycine variant in position 682 (Figure 3).

This deletion of theATP7Agene is located at a distance of 2.8\u2009Mb fromABCB7gene and eliminates the original translation start site in exon 2. We suggest that an alternative start codon, for example, in exon 3 can be instead used for the same open reading frame (predicted by ATGpr24). The resulting protein will lack the first 68 amino-acid residuals, which constitute the first of six metal-binding domains (MBDs) (Supplementary Figure 3B). As the ATP7A protein (NP_000043.4,Q04656) has six isoforms,25the deletion disrupts the open reading frame for the two short ones with unknown biological significance (Supplementary Figure 4). TheATP7Agene homologs are present in a broad range of organisms: from unicellular to complex multicellular organisms. The first MBD encoded by exon 2 is evolutionarily conserved in mammals, birds and reptiles. However, prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes have only one to three MDBs. We testedATP7Agene expression in the adult cortex and cerebellum and found the presence of a transcript product corresponding to protein-encoding transcript sequence in the frontal cortex but not in the cerebellum (Supplementary Figure 5).",
            "Mutations in theATP7Agene have been linked to copper deficiency/Menkes disease (MD; OMIM: 309400), characterized by severe mental retardation, seizures, growth retardation, hypothermia, kinky or steely hair, laxity of skin and joints and early age mortality. More mild occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is also associated with mutations in theATP7Agene (OMIM: 304150). Yet, neither of the clinical features of these diseases have been detected in Buryat patients lacking the second exon of theATP7Agene. We assumed that the deletion may have a relatively modest, if any, effect on clinical phenotype in these patients, which is unrelated to previously described clinical symptoms associated with mutations in theATP7Agene.",
            "Protein-coding retrogenePGAM4(Gene ID: 441531) is localized in the first intron of theATP7Agene and is transcribed from the opposite strand.PGAM4is a functional retrocopy ofPGAM1gene. Phosphoglycerate mutase catalyzes the isomerization reactions of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate in the glycolytic pathway. The gene for original functional enzymePGAM1is highly expressed in the brain (Illumina Human Body Map 2.0, ArrayExpress accession no. E-MTAB-513).26PGAM4retrogene has promoter-specific sequences of TATA boxes and CAAT box and is highly expressed in the testes. However, there is no evidence of activity of this gene in human cerebellum or cerebral cortical neurons27(Supplementary Figure 6). This retrogenePGAM4protein (NP_001025062,Q8N0Y7) has LxRHGExxxN motif specific for enzymatic activity of phosphoglycerate mutase family. ThePGAM4is present only in higher primates: human, chimpanzees and gorillas. The biological significance of the gene is unknown, butPGAM4has been associated with male fertility28and spermatogenesis.29Interestingly, although our data indicate that the full sequence ofPGAM4retrogene was lost, the Buryat patient with cerebellar pathology and carrier of the above-described X-linkedABCB7-ATP7A-PGAM4genetic variants was married and fathered three healthy sons. As anticipated, the genotyping of one of the sons available for this study revealed inheritance of X-chromosome wild-type allele from his mother. Given the potential role of thePGAM4gene on male fertility, we verified genetic paternity for the patient and his sons. Using homemade and commercial informative STR markers, we confirmed the authentic biological paternity of the patient bearing the X-linkedABCB7-ATP7A-PGAM4genetic variants. Thus, these results suggest that the naturally occurring knockout ofPGAM4does not disrupt the male fertility. However, given that all offsprings of the patient were males, the pathogenic effect of gene loss on generation or maintenance of X-chromosome-bearing spermatozoids cannot be ruled out.",
            "We found the mutation/deletion inABCB7andATP7Agenes in all four examined affected male relatives of this Buryat family with the same diagnosis and in four asymptomatic females relatives with the affected sons (Supplementary Table 6). The mutation/deletion was in the hemizygotic state in all examined affected males and in every female carrier it was heterozygous. All four examined healthy men from the same pedigree were hemizygous for wild-type alleles.",

The analysis of all exons of theABCB7gene by direct sequencing (Supplementary Table 8) did not exhibit any differences when compared with human reference genome sequences. Similarly, we found no deletion of exon 2 of theATP7Agene and retrogenePGAM4in affected males in these families. The genotyping of these families for mutationNM_001001344.2:c.3321G>A (p.Gly1107Asp) in theATP2B3gene, which was previously described in cases of cerebellum ataxia,4also revealed no difference from wild-type reference allele.",
            "The common feature among nonprogressive ataxias is a noticeable delay in early motor development and a disturbance of motor coordination during the life as a result of cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy. Here, we report a novel mutation inABCB7that is a causative factor of cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy and nonprogressive ataxia, thus further expanding the list of mutations in this gene linked to cerebellar ataxia. Previously, four different mutations found inABCB7were linked to cerebellar pathology with sideroblastic anemia. In sideroblastic anemia iron is not incorporated into hemoglobin as it is required to produce healthy erythrocytes by bone marrow. However, the remarkable feature of our case is that the patients have nonprogressive ataxia without the classic symptoms of sideroblastic anemia. It is tempting to speculate that this is because of a unique location of the mutation inABCB7. Alternatively, the deletion of N-terminal part of the ATP7A may potentially have a role in modifying the genetic factor.",
            "ABCB7 protein consists of six transmembrane domains and two intramitochondrial regions, forming NBD (Supplementary Figure 3A). It is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, as well as on the cytoplasmic membrane and in the cytoplasm.30ABCB7has an important role in maturation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Fe-S cluster proteins, affecting the function of cytochromec, NADH dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, the reduced form) and succinate dehydrogenase. It is involved in DNA repair and nucleotide excision repair, in oxidative DNA damage repair, in ribosome biogenesis and tRNA thiomodification.31The mutation of ABCB7 protein in our patients is located in the domain facing the inner mitochondrial space. All other mutations described to date, causing refractory anemia and ataxia, are localized near or in the transmembrane domains.20,32,33,34,35,36As such, this mutation may affect its activity or binding with other co-factors, as ABCB7 controls mitochondrial iron transport and protoporphyrin binding during hemoglobin synthesis.20,32,33,36",
            "The mental and neurological symptoms are varied in patients with described mutations in theABCB7gene. The depression, cognitive declines or intellectual disabilities and even schizophrenia were described for some patients (Supplementary Table 9). Neurological manifestations in the affected members of the Buryat family demonstrate some common features with theABCB7mutation \u2013 associated symptoms in other cases, such as cerebellar ataxia, lack of muscle weakness and deficiency of sensation (Supplementary Table 9). As shown by MRI in the Buryat family case, the brain atrophy was mostly localized in the cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis. However, we failed to detect abnormalities in other regions, including pons and medulla shown in other cases.34",
            "TheABCB7mutation in our patients is coupled with the deletion in ATPase copper-transporter gene (ATP7A) (Supplementary Figure 7). Surprisingly, the deletion in the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal part of ATP7A found in individuals from the Buryat family does not lead to disease manifestations described for carriers ofATP7Amutations. The disruption of this gene is linked to several clinically different disorders characterized by copper metabolic disturbance (OMIM: 300011) including MD (OMIM: 309400) and OHS (OMIM: 304150). Depending on the specific mutation, it can lead to early childhood lethality (before 3 years old), which is characterized by infantile-onset cerebral and cerebellar neurodegeneration, heavy mental retardation and arrest of development. A milder form of MD is not lethal and exhibits weaker clinical symptoms.37TheATP7Agene mutations also lead to OHS, characterized by a connective tissue disorder and skeletal abnormalities often associated with mild mental retardation (OMIM: 304150), or to distal motor neuropathy, characterized by motor nerve degeneration in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and atrophy of lower and upper extremities (OMIM: 300489). Interestingly, the expression of ATP7A protein is inversely correlated with the severity of the disease phenotype.38Despite the loss of the first of six MBDs of ATP7A, the patients from the Buryat family did not show any clinical signs of theATP7A-associated disorders reported to date. Among the mutation spectrum described forATP7Agene, the gross deletions were represented in ~15% of the MD patients.39Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in males carrying theATP7Adeletion of the first MBD, the remaining five copper-binding domains are efficiently used to retain the function ofATP7A.",
            "We cannot rule out that the dysfunction in ABCB7 and modestly modified activity of ATP7A may mutually affect homeostasis in some tissue cells, as ABCB7 impairment may cause an accumulation of iron ions in the mitochondria, whereas a mutation of ATP7A transporter may affect copper ion levels in the cell cytoplasm. The iron deficiency increases intestinal tissue expression of ATP7A40and brain copper levels.41Copper is known to regulate iron utilization in the bone marrow and in hemoglobin synthesis.42,43,44,45Importantly, bothABCB7andATP7Agenes are expressed in the bone marrow26,46and in various tissues (Illumina Human Body Map 2.0),26,46,47(Supplementary Figure 5). Given the mutual regulatory influence of the copper and iron uptake, the clinical phenotype described in the Buryat patients may depend on presumable interaction of genetic defects in two genes for the MBPs in some tissue cells, an interesting case of syndrome inherited as a X-linked monogenic trait. We, however, argue that the major cause of cerebellar hypoplasia and the clinical phenotype of ataxia in these patients is caused by this novel mutation in theABCB7gene.",

            "To elucidate whether Bronze Age population dispersals from the Eurasian Steppe to South Asia contributed to the gene pool of Indo-Iranian-speaking groups, we analyzed 19,568 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from northern Pakistani and surrounding populations, including 213 newly generated mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from Iranian and Dardic groups, both speakers from the ancient Indo-Iranian branch in northern Pakistan. Our results showed that 23% of mtDNA lineages with west Eurasian origin arose in situ in northern Pakistan since ~5000 years ago (kya), a time depth very close to the documented Indo-European dispersals into South Asia during the Bronze Age. Together with ancient mitogenomes from western Eurasia since the Neolithic, we identified five haplogroups (~8.4% of maternal gene pool) with roots in the Steppe region and subbranches arising (age ~5\u20132\u2009kya old) in northern Pakistan as genetic legacies of Indo-Iranian\u00a0speakers. Some of these haplogroups, such as W3a1b that have been found in the ancient samples from the late Bronze Age to the Iron Age period individuals of Swat Valley northern Pakistan, even have sub-lineages (age ~4\u2009kya old) in the southern subcontinent, consistent with the southward spread of Indo-Iranian languages. By showing that substantial genetic components of Indo-Iranian\u00a0speakers in northern Pakistan can be traced to Bronze Age in the Steppe region, our study suggests a demographic link with the spread of Indo-Iranian languages, and further highlights the corridor role of northern Pakistan in the southward dispersal of Indo-Iranian-speaking groups.",

            "As the world\u2019s most widely spoken language family (3.2 billion speakers) [1], the Indo-European (IE) languages recorded to predominate the Eurasian Steppe and beyond, extending some 8000\u2009km across Eurasia from East Asia (northeast China) to as far as Central Europe. One of the most widely accepted hypotheses posits that this language family originated in the Pontic Steppe in association with the formation and extension of the Yamnaya cultural complex during the Bronze Age (3000\u20131000bc) [2,3]. An alternative popular view suggests relatively earlier diffusion of IE languages from Anatolia with the expansion of farming (7000\u20136000bc) [4], which also has received support from ancient genome data [5]. In Europe, the expansion of some branches of IE languages from their eastern periphery has been suggested with the dispersal of Yamnaya-related populations, largely consistent with Bronze Age migrations from the Steppe [3,6]. However, controversy still exists regarding how the largest extant branch of IE languages, i.e., the Indo-Iranian family, expanded southward to South Asia. Certain studies have indicated substantial genetic contributions from western Eurasia introduced with the expansion of IE languages into South Asia (especially northern India) [7\u201310], whereas others have suggested that this genetic introgression is rather limited [11\u201314]. It is also widely argued that the early proto-Indo-Aryan speakers began to appear at the Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Southern Central Asia ~2000bcbefore they expanded to the South Asian borderlands [2]; however, recent report of genome-wide ancient DNA data from Central and South Asia suggests no substantial genetic contribution from BMAC to South Asians [10]. Therefore, it is still controversial about whether there are substantial genetic contributions from the Steppe into the South Asia along with the expansion of IE speakers. Moreover, due to the different extent of genetic admixtures between Indo-Iranian speakers and local populations in South Asia, such as Dravidian speakers [14], the genetic contributions from early Indo-Iranian speakers to the modern South Asians would be underestimated. Therefore, to address these issues, genetic studies on populations that are likely to be the first descendants from west Eurasia into the Indian subcontinent are critical.",
            "Located in the northernmost outpost of South Asia, at the brink of the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor, the Hindu Kush range of northern Pakistan has long been considered as a conduit for the migration of early Indo-Iranian speakers (often referred to as pastoralist groups from the Steppe) [2,15] who were likely pioneers for the introduction of IE languages into South Asia [2,16]. Distinct Indo-Aryan dialect complexes, natively spoken in this region and known as \u201cDardic,\u201d were broadly assumed to be the independent surviving remnants of the ancestors of Indo-Iranian speakers [17]. Anthropological and genetic studies have suggested that settlers in northern Pakistan, such as the Kalash and Kho, were historically and culturally isolated from their urbanized surroundings in South Asia and other extant Eurasian populations [18,19], thus probably representing early offshoots of the Vedic Aryans [20]. Moreover, the other major languages in this range, i.e., the eastern Iranians, can be traced back to Avestan scriptures [21], implying antiquity and long-term occupation of these IE language bearers along the northwestern region of South Asia. Therefore, genetic investigation into Dardic and Iranian speakers residing in northern Pakistan could help to elucidate the initial expansion of IE languages into South Asia if it can be linked to the Bronze Age demographic dispersals.",
            "In this study, we sequenced maternally transmitted mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from 213 Indo-Iranian language speakers (53 Iranian and 160 Dardic speakers) from the Hindu Kush mountain valleys along the northwestern periphery of Pakistan (Fig.1). Together with published ancient and modern mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data and radiocarbon-dated human bones and archeological artifacts from this region, we explored whether there are significant genetic contributions from the Eurasian Steppe in northern Pakistanis along with the expansion of IE languages.",

            "Based on the obtained mitogenome information, all 213 IE speakers in northern Pakistan could be allocated into haplogroups derived from non-African lineages M, N, and R. Most individuals in northern Pakistan (66.19%, 141/213) were affiliated to haplogroups HV, JT, and U (TableS8), which are reported to be prevalent in west Eurasians [40\u201342], at a much higher rate than that of other South Asian populations (24.9%) based on the 1KGP [27], Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) [43], and Bengali population data [13]. The distribution of unique diagnostic motifs of the haplogroups defined in our study is shared across Eurasia; however, some substitutions were more frequent in South Asians (TableS4), implying the consistent presence and de novo origination of these lineages in north Pakistan after differentiation\u00a0from western Eurasian counterparts.",
            "To further investigate the genetic relationship between the northern Pakistani populations and surroundings, a total of 19,757 samples from 294 population studies were analyzed covering IE and other language family-speaking populations from northern Pakistan and its surroundings, including Europe, the Middle East and\u00a0Caucasus, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia (Fig.1). The PCA plot based on haplogroup frequencies showed a general differentiation in IE-speaking populations between South Asia and Europe, with South Asian IE speakers distributed together with the Dravidians (Figs.2AandS1), consistent with the genetic admixture of these two linguistic groups observed in previous studies [14]. Haplogroups ubiquitous in present-day west Eurasians (e.g., mainly the descendants of haplogroups HV and JT) contributed most to PC1, whereas haplogroups prevalent in South Asia contributed to PC2 (Fig.2B). The association of the western Eurasian components with present-day South Asians is further supported by the correspondence analysis (Fig.S2). Moreover, some components, e.g., U5a sub-haplogroups that were prevalent in the Steppe during the Bronze Age [10], also contributed to PC2, implying potential genetic contributions from the Steppe into South Asia, including northern Pakistan.",

            "In comparison to IE speakers in India, populations residing in the northwestern regions of the subcontinent, including the Kho and Pashtuns in northern Pakistan, were more akin to populations from the west, especially those from the Central Asian Steppe, e.g., the Pamiris and Tajiks (Fig.2). This could be attributed to less deeply rooted Asian-specific lineages, such as macrohaplogroup \u201cM\u201d and its derivatives, in our northern Pakistani samples (18.3%) than in the southern subcontinent populations [27,43] (47%), as well as substantial haplogroup sharing (e.g., HV and J) between northern Pakistanis and Central Asians (Fig.S3). These affinities would have been established since ancient times, as evident from archaeological studies documenting ancient population movements between west Eurasia and the Indus peripheral region [44]. Further evidence comes from the gradual decrease in west Eurasian component from north Pakistan to the southeastern Indian subcontinent based on admixture estimation (TableS9). Moreover, the diversity indices of those lineages in northern Pakistan, which are prevalent in western Eurasians, show higher nucleotide diversities in northern Pakistan than in the southern subcontinent, implying longer differentiation of these lineages in the northwestern subcontinent (TableS10). These results together suggest that the Indo-Iranian populations in northern Pakistan retained more genetic components from western Eurasia in comparison with the IE-speaking populations in the southern Indian subcontinent.",
            "Based on phylogeographic analysis of all available mitogenome data, we updated the phylogeographic status of the western Eurasian lineages in South Asia (TableS4) and identified 29 haplogroups which are prevalent in South Asia, and would have differentiated independently with derived branches in this region (Fig.S4). Five of these\u00a0haplogroups, which had been\u00a0reported in our previous work [22] (i.e., H2a1a3, J2b1a7a, R0a5a, U2e1h1, and U4a1f) were also reassessed together with the new haplogroup branches. Age estimations utilizing different mtDNA mutation rates and different methods indicated that the ages of these 29 haplogroups ranged from 10.14 to 0.5\u2009kya (TableS11), with most (20/29) <5\u2009kya old in South Asia (TableS11and Fig.S4), a time subsequent to the major Bronze Age processes occurring in the Eurasian Steppe, e.g., eastern extensions of IE and related cultures advancing from Yamnaya about 3000bc[2]. Specifically, among the 20 haplogroups that can be traced back to the Bronze Age period, 12 were distributed exclusively in northern Pakistan and 4 were ubiquitous in both the north and southern mainland (Fig.S4), accounting for ~23% of our northern Pakistani samples. Considering the restrictive distribution of these haplogroups in north Pakistan and the surroundings, it is possible that these haplogroups differentiated independently in this area. Therefore, the ages of these haplogroups would reflect the upper bound of their arrival times into north Pakistan. These results thus suggest substantial genetic contributions to the northern Pakistani gene pool since the beginning of the Bronze Age. This finding was further supported by Bayesian-based analysis, which illustrated that the majority of these west Eurasian lineages coalesced 5\u2009kya in north Pakistan (Fig.S5). Interestingly, this extensive genetic contributions from west Eurasia during the Bronze Age is in agreement with the substantial settlements evidenced by the increasing number of archaeological remains in northern Pakistan with14C dates from the beginning of the Bronze Age (TableS3and Fig.S6), which are broadly interpreted as remnants of Indo-Iranian speakers from the region [45].",
            "Further analysis, together with ancient mitogenome data, was conducted to assess past genetic contact between northern Pakistan and western Eurasia. Some haplogroups were found to have ancestors or sister lineages predominantly in the Middle East and the Caucasus (i.e., R0a5a, T1a2c, R2e, U7a3b1, and J1b1b1d) (TableS7and Fig.S4), reflecting a likely genetic connection between northern Pakistan and the Middle East [46]. Similarly, several lineages (i.e., W3b2, I4b1, J1d7, U7a6, U7a2c, U7a3a1, U7b3, T2o, and T2d1b3) showed even more complex branching, with siblings found in the Middle East as well as further north in the Steppe, but mostly lacking upstream branches from the southern subcontinent (Fig.S4). Given the existence of genetic introgression from Anatolian farmers into Yamnaya ancestries [5], and the lack of Anatolian ancestry in South Asians after ~6000bc[10], it is likely that these lineages would have been introduced into north Pakistanis by Steppe pastoralists, who accepted genetic contributions from Anatolian farmers. However, the possibility that the bearers of those haplogroups were early Iranian farmers [46] who further mixed with pastoralists in the BMAC [10] cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the absence of haplogroup K1 in our data, which is often associated with Neolithic dispersals from Anatolia [47], further supports the above admixture scenarios. Other haplogroups that would have been transported with these past genetic contacts, e.g., H5a1r and especially J2b1a7a, with ancestor types and sibling lineages in Europe, would have moved from the Europe and reached the Hindu Kush region, probably during the Bronze Age onward [22].",
            "We further focused on haplogroups displaying direct connections between northern Pakistan and the Steppe region. Results indicated that haplogroup U2e1h1 (age 7.06\u20139.55\u2009kya), which had ancestor types distributed in the Steppe region, likely originated therein. One possible explanation for the prevalence in northern Pakistan with coalescent ages\u2009>7\u2009kya could be its presence in this region for more than 7000 years, and advent to northern Pakistan before the early Bronze Age Yamnaya expansion [12]. However, whether this kind of haplogroups are part of the common Eurasian-shared ancestry and remain visible in north Pakistan through genetic drift or originated elsewhere ~7\u20139\u2009kya and dispersed into this region during the Bronze Age cannot be ruled out. Given the uncertainty of their expansion time into northern Pakistan, it is difficult to speculate whether U2e1h1 expanded with the spread of IE languages during the Bronze Age.",
            "Differently, other haplogroups, with coalescent ages estimated since about 5\u2009kya, such as J1b1a1f (age 2.63\u20133.53\u2009kya, one outlier 12.07\u2009kya was disregarded), U4a1f (age 2.52\u20135.00\u2009kya), and H2b1 (2.35\u20135.25\u2009kya) (TableS11), have ancestor and sister lineages found in Europe and the Steppe region (Fig.S4). These haplogroups, especially J1b1a1f and U4a1f which showed independent differentiations in north Pakistan, thus would have been introduced into the northern Pakistani Indo-Iranian-speaker gene pool after 5\u2009kya, consistent with the arrival of Indo-Iranian-speaking groups in northern South Asia during the Bronze Age (~2300\u20131200bc) [12]. Thus, these haplogroups could be considered as genetic legacies of IEs from the Steppe region. Additional support comes from haplogroup U4a1f, whose ancestor type (U4a1) was found in Neolithic samples from Europe and, importantly, in Yamnaya samples from the western Steppe (Fig.S4). Similarly, haplogroup W3a1a4 (age 2.35\u20135.25\u2009kya) and sub-haplogroups of W3a1b (e.g., W3a1b1, age 2.63\u20136\u2009kya, distributed in both northern Pakistan and the southern subcontinent), with the sister type W3a1a found in ancient Yamnaya samples, could also have Yamnaya-related origination. Other haplogroups, e.g., H2a1a3 (age 0.88\u20133.00\u2009kya) with ancestor node in the eastern and central Steppe, likely suggest dispersals into northern Pakistan along with the expansion of Bronze Age cultures such as the Andronovo (a late Bronze Age culture also associated with early Indo-Iranian groups) (Fig.3A). These haplogroups, viz., J1b1a1f, U4a1f, H2a1a3, W3a1a4, and W3a1b subbranches, can therefore trace their ancestry to the Steppe region and would have descended from populations therein during the Bronze Age (Fig.3A, B). As their coalescent ages in northern Pakistan\u00a0and the radiocarbon dates of their ancient Eurasian counterparts (Fig.3B) fit well with the timing of the spread of IE languages into South Asia, the most probable explanation would be that these lineages were introduced into the gene pool of northern Pakistani Indo-Iranian speakers from the Steppe region from the beginning of the Bronze Age, at least according to currently available evidence.",

            "Interestingly, the IE genetic legacy from the Steppe region, i.e., H2a1a3, J1b1a1f, U4a1f, and subbranch of W3a1, accounted for 8.4% of our northern Pakistani samples, which is much more pronounced than that in the southern subcontinent populations (~1.7%) in the 1KGP [27] and HGDP [43] data sets. This implies a greater genetic contribution from the Steppe region to the northern Pakistanis than to the southern South Asians. One explanation could be the influence of demographic processes (e.g., genetic drift or founder effect) resulting in the retention of a greater genetic legacy from IE speakers in northern Pakistanis. However, considering the closer genetic affinity between the southern subcontinent Indo-Iranian and Dravidian speakers (Fig.S1), it is more likely that this difference is due to the southward migration of IE speakers via northern Pakistan, during which they assimilated maternal genetic components from contemporary non-IE-speaking groups, consistent with substantial ancestry from the Steppe in present-day South Asians [10]. This scenario finds further support from the southward dispersals of Steppe legacy of IEs in northern Pakistan in our analysis. For example, W3a1b, with root types found in both modern individuals and individuals of prehistorical and early historical periods in the Swat Valley, northern Pakistan [10], had subbranches W3a1b1, W3a1b2, and W3a1b3 that arose in situ in the southern subcontinent, especially India (Table1and Fig.3A, C). The estimated ages of sub-haplogroups of W3a1b (W3a1b1: 3.53\u2009kya, W3a1b2: 4.14\u2009kya) were further confirmed with BEAST estimations (Table1) and echoed the arrival time of IE speakers in India in the late Bronze Age (~1500bc). Therefore, the genetic legacy of IE speakers in northern Pakistan also contributed to the gene pools of the southern subcontinent populations along with IE language expansion, indicating that the southward IE language expansion was not simply mediated by cultural diffusion. These results highlight the corridor role of the Hindu Kush region of northern Pakistan in genetic introgression from the Steppe to South Asia during the Bronze Age, which would have been mediated by the southward expansion of IE speakers, consistent with views from archaeological and linguistic studies [17,19,44,45].",

            "BSP analysis was carried out to elucidate the impact of Bronze Age Eurasian migrations on the population dynamics of South Asia. Results indicated an increase in the effective population size (Ne) for northern Pakistani populations from ~18\u2009kya (Fig.4A), although relatively flat, likely facilitated by the climatic improvements after the last glacial maximum. TheNeof northern Pakistanis remained stable during the postglacial period and even during the Neolithic, in agreement with recent reports on modern and ancient genomes from South Asia [9,48]. In brief, our results indicated that the Neolithic expansion into South Asia from 8\u2009kya did not strongly affect the population size in northern Pakistan, thus suggesting any major genetic influx from the Iranian plateau during the Neolithic into the region to be unlikely. Surprisingly, a population decrease was observed in the northern Pakistanis after 5\u2009kya, which lasted until 1.02\u2009kya (Fig.4A). This differs from the signal observed from Bronze Age lineages and the genetic legacy of IE speakers from the Steppe, which displayed intensive growth from 5\u2009kya (Fig.4B, C) and likely reflected a rapid population expansion of pastoralist groups from the Steppe after their migration into northern Pakistan. These BSP trends were reevaluated utilizing a relaxed clock model using the same data sets, with highly similar results, but with less intense population decline trend in northern Pakistan since 5\u2009kya (Fig.S7). To further avoid any potential artifacts arising in BSP methodology [49], we calculated Tajima\u2019sDand obtained a positive value (0.63550), indicative of population shrinkage in this region (TableS10) and lending support to the BSP results. One explanation for this decline may be the depletion of natural resources or habitat in the region after the arrival of Steppe pastoralists ~5.5\u2009kya, which may have led to a population decrease [44,50]. However, the influence of\u00a0other factors, such as social structure changes, population size fluctuations, natural selection, and quaternary climatic oscillations between the northern hemisphere and South Asian monsoon [44], should not be ignored. More studies should be carried out to confirm this population decrease.",

            "In summary, based on available archeological and high-resolution mitogenome data from northwestern Pakistan, especially from Iranian and Dardic populations, who are suggested to be the surviving traces of early Indo-Iranian groups, we identified the genetic contributions of different dispersals from west Eurasia into northern Pakistan during the Bronze Age onward. Importantly, we identified five haplogroups as the genetic legacy of IE speakers from the Eurasian Steppe, likely dispersed along with the migration of IE-speaking populations during the Bronze Age into northern Pakistan, thus implying that IE language expansion into South Asia was not simply mediated by cultural diffusion. This migration contributed 8.4% of the gene pool of northern Pakistani IE speakers, suggesting this demographic connection, which is a possible source of IE language diffusion, could be one part of the complex demographic history of the region. Our results also provide implications on the two main hypotheses of IE language origination, viz. Anatolia and Steppe hypotheses. Considering that Steppe components were observed in all Indo-Iranian groups in northern Pakistan in our study, as well as in other regions in South Asia [10], while lineages possibly representing the genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers, e.g., R2e, K1, were either absent or not found in all of the IE-speaking groups in northern Pakistan, our results lend more support to the Steppe hypothesis, at least from a matrilineal perspective. Furthermore, these IE speakers, as evidenced by the genetic legacy identified here, also moved southward and contributed genetically, though to a rather limited extent, to the Indian subcontinent, suggesting northern Pakistan as a corridor in the spread of IE languages during the Bronze Age dispersals into South Asia. Since our study is only based on mtDNA data, which only reflect maternal histories of populations, more investigations based on genome-wide data are\u00a0also needed to intensively dissect the expansion of IE speakers into South Asia.",

            "The historical province of Dobruja, located in southeastern Romania, has experienced intense human population movement, invasions, and conflictual episodes during the Middle Ages, being an important intersection point between Asia and Europe. The most informative source of maternal population histories is the complete mitochondrial genome of archaeological specimens, but currently, there is insufficient ancient DNA data available for the medieval period in this geographical region to complement the archaeological findings. In this study, we reconstructed, by using Next Generation Sequencing, the entire mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of six medieval individuals neglectfully buried in a multiple burial from Capidava necropolis (Dobruja), some presenting signs of a violent death. Six distinct maternal lineages (H11a1, U4d2, J1c15, U6a1a1, T2b, and N1a3a) with different phylogenetic background were identified, pointing out the heterogeneous genetic aspect of the analyzed medieval group. Using population genetic analysis based on high-resolution mitochondrial data, we inferred the genetic affinities of the available medieval dataset from Capidava to other ancient Eurasian populations. The genetic data were integrated with the archaeological and anthropological information in order to sketch a small, local piece of the mosaic that is the image of medieval European population history.",
            "Over thousands of years, the Lower Danube Basin witnessed striking social and cultural changes and several waves of human population migrations that have contributed to the shaping of the current European genetic landscape. Large-scale studies1\u20134on the ancient DNA (aDNA) preserved in human archaeological remains, a direct proof of mankind\u2019s historical past, have brought to light significant genetic evidence to answer some puzzling questions regarding complex past interactions. Most of them shed light on the genomic history of different European regions from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age, whereas the genetic heritage mirrored in more recent time transects remains partly obscured due to the limited number of analyzed samples and/or populations. This scenario reflects the situation of southeastern Europe. Based on the genomes of four prehistoric samples from Romania, Gonz\u00e1lez Forteset al.5revealed that the Neolithization process in this area relied on the movement of both people and ideas. The analysis and interpretation of genome-wide aDNA data from more than 200 individuals inhabiting southeastern Europe between 12,000 and 500 BC, showed that this geographical region \u201cserved as a genetic contact zone between east and west over thousands of years6\u201d. This pattern was also observed in a small medieval group of individuals from southeastern Romania (Dobruja)7. The genetic connections to Central Asia were reflected by the presence of the N9a haplotype in 2 out of 10 successfully analyzed samples7. Evidence from present-day maternal haplogroup diversity in the historical provinces of Romania showed that the Asian influence in Dobruja is greater than in the other regions, and suggested that the Carpathian Arch might have had an influential role in migration patterns8. Other findings from ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) research revealed the contribution of Hungarian Conquerors to the gene pool of the Carpathian Basin and suggested that most probably they descended from steppe nomadic people9. However, the archaeogenetic picture of medieval southeastern Europe is far from being complete.",
            "The aim of the current study is to catch a glimpse into the maternal population history of the Lower Danube Basin by integrating full-length mitochondrial data with archaeological and anthropological evidence of a small group of medieval individuals (C58 archaeological complex) discovered in southeastern Romania (Capidava necropolis). This study is an attempt in understanding why these individuals were collectively buried in a particular fashion, which contrasts with the typical Christian medieval funerary practices observed at the same site, to evaluate the levels of variability within this group, and the relationships to other ancient populations from Eurasia.",
            "Capidava fortress (Capidava village, Constan\u021ba County), a civil and military center after the Roman conquest, stands on the right bank of the Danube, halfway between H\u00e2r\u0219ova (Carsium fortress) and Cernavod\u0103 (Axiopolis fortress), the road linking the localities passing by the walls of the fortress. The first archaeological surveys in the Capidava area started at the beginning of the 20thcentury and were initiated by Vasile P\u00e2rvan and Grigore Florescu10. Archaeological research in and near the Capidava fortress has started in 1924 and continues without major interruptions to date, but until recently the biological material discovered here was not fully exploited. The archaeological excavations have highlighted dramatic changes of the fortress structure since it was built at the end of the third century AD10,11. At the end of the 6thcentury AD, after the Huns burned down the fortress, a small quadrilateral fort occupying the southern quarter of the precinct was built. A century later, amid the attacks of Avars and Slavs, the fortress was completely destroyed and abandoned by the last troops overseeing the area. In the 10thcentury another wave of destruction and rebuilding was recorded, this time the walls being reconstructed following the initial pattern used in Roman times11. During the 10th-11thcenturies, the Lower Danube Basin was politically part of the Byzantine Empire. This was a troubled period, with complex interactions between several populations (Bulgarians, Kievans, and Turkics). As Capidava fortress is placed on the fringe of the Danubian Byzantine Empire, many migratory populations used this settlement in their passage12. Due to lack of solid archaeological evidence, particularly absence of any grave goods, the individuals from the C58 archaeological complex, the subject of this study, cannot be associated to any invasive ethnic groups or to any local populations (Bulgarians, Vlachs, Byzantines etc.).",
            "The assemblage of human skeletal remains belonging to the ten individuals was placed in a multiple burial pit (C58) and was not arranged according to the Christian burial customs of the medieval period, as observed in the majority of the graves from this archaeological site (simple, quadrilateral inhumation graves, generally west-east oriented skeletons in dorsal decubitus). The skeletons were found on the bottom of an elliptical pit, with no artifacts present (Supplementary Fig.S2). It is highly likely that the individuals were buried reasonably soon after death, as they were partially articulated, spatial position of body segments was kept after skeletonization, no animal predation marks were observed on bones, and no secondary disturbances were detected in the stratigraphy. The C58 archaeological complex is located near similar structures (circular pits) with potential uses as storage, waste disposal or loess exploitation (Supplementary Fig.S1). Radiocarbon dating results show that the analyzed funerary complexes were not contemporaneous, the C58 multiple burial pit being older (773\u2013906\u2009cal. AD) than the C143 single grave (962\u20131040\u2009cal. AD). Previous radiocarbon dating is available for Cap-M4 (880\u2013990\u2009cal. AD) an individual buried according to Christian funerary custom in terrace B of the necropolis7,12.",
            "The anthropological analysis revealed that the skeletal material from the C58 grave can be attributed to a minimum number of ten individuals. All results pertaining to the osteological analysis are summarized in the Supplementary TableS1. The skeletons were conserved in proportions ranging from 23 to 86%, and missing osteological inventory was absent exclusively due to taphonomic reasons. Case descriptions are only briefly outlined here because an osteological catalog for all individuals recovered since 2010 until present will be subsequently published together with a more thorough analysis of the archaeological contexts for this site. The skeletal material is composed of seven adult and three subadult individuals. There were six adults for which the sex could be estimated based on the cranial features and the morphology of the pelvic bones13. Sex distribution is rather imbalanced, as four of the individuals displayed male typical morphological features (Cap-C58-1, Cap-C58-2, Cap-C58-3, and Cap-C58-5) and the remaining two exhibited skeletal markers which indicate that they were probably females (Cap-C58-6, and Cap-C58-11). This small group of individuals is pretty diverse in terms of age since only the old adult category is absent. The male individuals recovered from the C58 funerary assemblage exhibited signs of violent traumas (Supplementary Fig.S3). The bioarchaeological analysis revealed the presence of two antemortem injuries on the scapula of two individuals, both with infection signs, and four perimortem wounds, one of which was identified on the posterior lateral epicondyle of C58-5s\u2019 left humerus. Each of the C58-1, C58-2, and C58-5 male individuals displayed one perimortem trauma on the frontal bone, two of which were sharp force traumas (C58-1 and C58-5) and one blunt force trauma (C58-2).",
            "We successfully reconstructed the complete mitochondrial genomes for all six individuals from the Capidava multiple burial selected for molecular analysis. The bioinformatics processing of the raw reads reveals that the resulted sequences for all analyzed samples reach standard quality requested to assure the authenticity of the NGS data. The details of NGS data for each sample are summarized in the Supplementary TableS2. Using hybridization capture in solution14combined with high-throughput sequencing, six whole mitochondrial genomes were generated with the depth of average coverage ranging from 69x to 176x. The DNA damage profile of the samples and average fragment length were used as criteria of authentication in an iterative probabilistic approach15that allows to estimate human contamination and to reconstruct the endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. The rates of cytosine deamination at the 5\u2032 end of the molecules were high, varying from 24.7% to 41.3%. The resulted mtDNA fragments are short, with a median length of 57.87 base pairs (bp) which ranges in the typical size length for aDNA16. In addition, the percentage of possible present-day human contamination was evaluated in order to further asses the authenticity of the ancient mitochondrial genomes. No significant levels of contamination were detected, as shown in the Supplementary TableS2.",
            "The mutation patterns revealed by the analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes of six samples from the C58 archaeological complex can be classified into five macro-haplogroups (H, J, N, T, and U) (Supplementary TableS3). The maternal genetic composition of the Capidava multiple burial appears to consist of six different west Eurasian haplogroups (H11a1, J1c15, N1a3a, T2b, U4d2, and U6a1a1) with no east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages detected.",
            "A total number of 306 complete human mtDNA records (Supplementary TableS4) were found to match the maternal lineages of the investigated medieval individuals and were used for the construction of phylogenetic networks in order to outline the geographic affinities and genetic relationships of the Capidava multiple burial individuals. A small number of equivalent haplotypes from literature could not be properly aligned due to incomplete sequences, and these were not used in the phylogenetic networks.",
            "MtDNA sequences of medieval Capidava multiple burial were depicted in six Median-Joining Networks. Samples falling within the same sub-haplogroup as those studied are emphasized by a blue circle. The networks are color-coded according to the \u201cTraits block\u201d of the Nexus-format alignments. Three different attributes (represented by three different colors) were used in order to discern between the samples analyzed in this study and other present-day or historical samples. Red nodes correspond to the Capidava samples, orange circles represent ancient samples and the modern ones are colored green. Black circles represent hypothetical haplotypes. The sizes of the circles are proportional to the frequency of each haplotype; the smallest colored circles representing only one sample. The numbers of cross lines in the branches between adjacent nodes denote number of mutations. The length of the branches is not relevant as they were adjusted to fit the page. The closest samples to those studied are labeled with GenBank accession number and their geographical origin.",
            "The increased level of resolution of full length mtDNA data allowed for the identification of direct links among closely related ancient and modern mitogenomes and for the precise assignment of geographic affinities. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three C58 haplogroups, H11a1 (Fig.1), U4d2 (Fig.2), and J1c15 (Fig.3), are ubiquitous in Eurasia, while the T2b clade is widely spread across Europe (Fig.4). The closest sequence matches elucidated using median-joining networks pointed to geographic affinities restricted to the Middle East in case of N1a3a (Fig.5) and to the Mediterranean region for U6a1a1 (Fig.6).",

            "Pairwise genetic distances were calculated based on the complete mitochondrial genomes of 18 ancient Eurasian populations, including the medieval Capidava group (Supplementary TableS5). Due to the fact that our investigated population is small (six samples) we grouped it together with four of the formerly published medieval samples from this necropolis7. The medieval population from Capidava showed the lowest distances from four ancient populations: Bronze Age population of the Balkan Peninsula (Balkans_BA) (FST=\u2009\u22120.0348), Srubnaya (SRU) (FST=\u2009\u22120.02367), Poltavka-Potapovka (PBA) (FST=\u2009\u22120.01677), and Hungarian Conquerors (HUN_Conq) (FST=\u2009\u22120.01325); these values were not significant (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Five ancient groups (SBA, Scand, NEN, HUN_BA, and BBC) appeared most distant to the individuals in our dataset, displaying significant differentiation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.7). The exact FSTvalues and their corresponding p-values are listed in the Supplementary TableS6.",

            "These genetic distances were visualized by displaying the linearized Slatkin FSTvalues on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot (Fig.8). The resulted plot reflects the extremely tight connection between the ROU-med and Bronze Age population from the Pontic-Caspian steppe (Late Bronze Age Srubnaya culture and its ancestors Potapovka and Poltavka). The investigated medieval dataset also shows strong affinities to the Bronze Age population from the Balkans and to the Hungarian Conquerors, groups which are geographically close to the medieval population from Romania. Near Eastern Neolithic, Sintashta-Andronovo, and Bell Beaker seem to be the most distant populations relative to the Capidava group.",

            "The analysis and interpretation of the available bioarchaeological data provides some evidence regarding past human interaction patterns and mortuary practices, while genetic analysis points out biological relationships among individuals. However, it is only possible to speculate about the reasons for which the C58 individuals, who died at roughly the same time, were buried together in such a special and rare funerary context. They showed no clear pattern of organization which suggests that they were rather disposed of into the pit, as opposed to ritual deposition, possible due to haste and/or lack of consideration for the dead. In contrast, previously published medieval Capidava samples12, and yet unpublished samples were individually buried according to Christian rituals with few associated bronze artifacts. The pathological conditions identified on these human remains (dental enamel hypoplasia,cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, dental disease, periosteal inflammation, and osteolytic lesions on the vertebrae) possibly reflect the poor life quality of this group of individuals. When comparing the presence of pathological features between the individuals from the C58 complex and the ones from the rest of the necropolis, a slight increase in the incidence of stress indicators can be seen.Cribra orbitaliahas an incidence of 20% in the C58 group and 17% in the necropolis group, while porotic hyperostosis occurs in 50% of the individuals from the C58 complex and in only 7% of the individuals from the necropolis. Linear enamel hypoplasia is present in 18% of the individuals from the necropolis, while in the C58 complex, it occurs in 10% of the cases. It is very likely that they had experienced one or more of the following: nutritional deficiencies, physiological stress during childhood, repetitive physical activity, and low immunological status. With regard to trauma and fractures, 8% of the individuals from the necropolis group suffered cranial trauma, while a much higher incidence, 30%, can be seen in the C58 complex. All adults show mild signs of osteoarthritis, mainly on the long bones of the upper and lower limbs, which can be associated with moderate physical activity during their lifetime. The marginal social status (e.g. outsiders, heretics, prisoners, slaves, poor, etc.17) of this group at the time and place of their deaths seems a reasonable explanation when correlating the inconsiderate burial with the observed pathologies. The pattern of physical trauma observed here indicates a violent death for nearly half of the individuals, all of them males, which might be the result of some kind of skirmish. A higher frequency of skeletal trauma in males in comparison to females is not unexpected, because they were usually involved in more physically challenging and dangerous activities than females18. The prevalence of frontal craniofacial injuries determined in all analyzed male individuals could be a consequence of an imbalanced fatal physical confrontation. This injury pattern indicates that these individuals were not attacked from behind (execution style). Cuts on the humerus and rib of Cap-C58-5 suggest he might have been involved in a physical struggle. Skeletal evidence of deliberate interpersonal violence was previously recorded, being linked to different historical periods such as Neolithic multiple and collective graves from Germany19, a Copper Age mass grave from the territory of Croatia20, and Early Iron Age settlements from Dobruja17. The number of similar cases that date to the medieval period is limited to few notable examples21. For instance, the first attempt at identifying the reasons for the violent death of late medieval individuals buried in a mass grave from the University Square (Bucharest, Romania) was recently documented22. Comparable examples to the analyzed sample set in terms of demographic profiles (high number of women and children) were best explained by raids23, attacks that usually result in killing everyone encountered24. The disorganized body positions and the absence of religious rites specific to the medieval period observed in the C58 complex suggest that these individuals were perhaps outsiders (geographical, social or religious), unwanted or without rights in the local community whose representatives are not evident, at this point, in the adjacent necropolis.",
            "A very similar multiple burial was discovered in the proximity of Capidava fortress in the 1959 archaeological campaign by Florescuet al. and published three years later25. The exact location of the multiple burial and the spatial relationship to the C58 burial cannot currently be accurately identified based on the published landmarks. This grave contains, according to the authors, a minimum number of nine individuals, similarly disposed of as the remains in C58, 8 adults and 1 child with possible supplementary remains belonging to one or more infants. Analyses concerning sex, age at death and traumas of these individuals were not recorded in this or ulterior publications. Nevertheless, a small paragraph pertaining to the position of the skeletal remains of a child from this grave (1959) raises the hypothesis that it may have been decapitated. In contrast to the multiple burial discussed in the present paper, the 1959 burial contained also fragments of metallic armour used in the archaeological dating of the context at 9th-10thcentury AD25. The 1959 multiple burial human remains were not available for genetic analyses. The presence of two similar archaeological contexts dated to approximately the same age, by different means, seems to hint to a period of local turmoil and vulnerability for local and/or transiting groups.",
            "The nucleotide substitution patterns displayed by the complete mitochondrial genome of each C58 individual, the absence of identical haplotypes amongst them, show the lack of close maternal relationships between the studied samples. Other kinds of biological relationships (e.g. paternal) cannot be excluded. Four individuals (three subadults and one female) were not selected for aDNA analysis because of their poor preservation and absence of teeth.",
            "None of the haplotypes present in the multiple burial individuals matches the other five whole mitochondrial genomes found in the previously published samples7(Supplementary TableS5) or the haplogroups that were identified by the analysis of the control region sequences in the other five individuals previously published7. These two groups of individuals which have been discovered in the same site, but in different archaeological contexts (C58 Information Center point and individuals from B terrace) share two macro-haplogroups, namely N and U. The higher level of classification based on complete mtDNA data revealed that the derivative lineages clustered under N macro-haplogroups are distinct (N1a3a: Cap-C58-9; N9a9: Cap-M9 and Cap-M11) and have different phylogenetic backgrounds. Two lineages descending from the common ancestor U were found in each set of individuals (U4d2 and U6a1a1 were detected in the multiple burial samples, while U5a1c2a and U3a were identified in the previously published samples7). Derivative sub-branches of haplogroups J and T which are commonly distributed across Europe were exclusively found in the multiple burial individuals of all genetically processed samples from this necropolis. Haplogroup H, the most widely spread and diverse maternal lineage in Europe was observed in lower frequencies among the samples from C58 complex than in the other medieval samples from Capidava. The influence of the maternal familial relationships on the funerary ritual is suggested by the presence of identical haplotypes only in adjacently buried individuals (single graves)7.",
            "All the haplogroups identified in the ancient samples from this study are also present in the modern Romanian population as shown by the mtDNA control region sequences of 714 Romanians8. The only matching haplotype is T2b which was detected in modern samples from all historical provinces of Romania, except Dobruja. Most probably the other haplotypes could not be detected in modern samples due to the small resolution of the control region data and/or to low frequencies of these haplotypes in the modern population. Of all haplogroups described in this study, the most frequent one in the modern Romanian population is J1c, which is most common in present-day Dobruja individuals. Haplogroups H11 and U4 are more frequent in modern Walachia and Moldavia than in Transylvania, while N1a is absent from the Transylvanian set.",
            "The Cap-C58-1 sample contains all defining mutations for H11a1, a descendant subclade of the common western Eurasian H11 haplogroup, as well as a private mutation 16261\u2009T. Similar genetic profiles are currently distributed across most of the northern, central and eastern Europe and in Central Asia. H11a was identified in a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer of the Narva culture from Lithuania (Spiginas1)26, in a Bronze Age sample from Hungary (Rise247)2and was also found associated to the Unetice culture (BZH1)27. H11a1 was found in a medieval sample belonging to an adult female of the Hungarian Conquest period9, but it is not an exact match to the C58-1 sample (Fig.1).",
            "The U4d2 haplotype is currently distributed in some geographic areas of Eurasia, being most frequent in populations of Eastern Europe (Volga Tatars and Slavic speaking groups) and in aboriginal Siberians (Yakuts, Tuvinians, Khakassians) (Supplementary TableS4). It has been suggested that U4d2 branch might be of Slavic origin due to its high incidence in Slavic-speaking populations and it might have expanded into Central Europe and Siberia from Eastern Europe28. This haplotype includes three ancient maternally inherited genomes, all from Hungarian Conquerors9. The haplotype of Cap-C58-2 contains all of the expected U4d2 diagnostic mutations aside from 16189\u2009C, and four personal transitions. The same maternal genetic signature occurs in present-day Slavic populations (Poland, Russia, and Serbia) (Fig.2).",
            "The polymorphism distinguished in the complete mtDNA sequence of Cap-C58-3 can be classified as J1c15, a derivative sub-branch of the most prevalent form (J1c) of J macro-haplogroup in present-day Europe. This specific haplotype variant is rare in modern mtDNA data and seems to be connected mainly to the Near East, more sparsely to Europe and, to our knowledge, is absent from the published ancient datasets. The detected J1c15 haplotype is most similar to a sample observed in the gene pool of Tatars inhabiting the territory of the middle Volga River29(Fig.3).",
            "Mitochondrial consensus sequence of Cap-C58-6 belongs to the T2b haplogroup, a major sublineage of T2 that spread into Europe from the Near Eastern refuges30. Equivalent haplotypes were found in remains from the Linear Pottery culture (LBK) in Central Europe31and in an Early Neolithic skeleton from north-western Anatolia (I1099)1(Fig.4). The same T2b haplotype was identified in various present-day European populations, which could indicate its European origin.",
            "N1a3a sub-branch defined by the 16201\u2009T substitution was detected in the Cap-C58-9 sample. The phylogenetic network analysis (Fig.5) reveals that the Capidava sample which lacks only the 207\u2009A defining mutation for N1a3 is most closely related to modern samples originating from Iran, Levant, and Cyprus. The current geographic distribution of this maternal lineage shows that it is mainly restricted to the Middle East, being extremely rare in central-east Europe (Romanians, Poles, Belarusians, and Tatars of the Volga-Ural region), being indicative thus of Middle Eastern genetic traces in Europeans32. Ancient N1a3a haplotypes were documented in an Iron Age sample from Iran33and a Middle Bronze Age individual from Lebanon34.",
            "Cap-C58-5 displays the mutational motif for U6a1a1, a derived lineage nested within U6a1 which is spread from the Near East to northwestern Africa35. This subclade (U6a1a1) currently occurs at high frequencies in the central-western Mediterranean range as shown in Fig.6. Its highest frequencies across the European continent are restricted to the Iberian and Italian peninsulas. This particular mitochondrial variant was not found in the published ancient mitogenomes, but other U6a haplotypes were previously reported for six Taforalt individuals attesting their preHolocene presence in the Maghreb36and basal haplogroup U6 has been identified in a 35,000-year-oldHomo sapiensfrom Romania (Muierii cave)37.",
            "The maternal genetic composition of the Capidava population as represented by all analyzed samples points to a mixed origin from multiple sources. The high-resolution mtDNA data of the individuals buried in single graves in the necropolis, display genetic affinities towards Central and Eastern Europe and to Central Asia7. In contrast, according to the phylogenetic analysis of the C58 haplotypes, multiple connections with ancient Middle East mtDNA genomes from different historical periods were found1,33,34, as well as links to the medieval Hungarian conquerors9. Close genetic ties to the Conquerors were also exposed by the population genetic analysis (Figs7and8). It is worth noting that the medieval Hungarian samples used for genetic distances are different from those used for phylogenetic reconstruction, a fact which increases the strength of this apparent connection. It has been argued by Nepar\u00e1czkiet al.9that the best fitting origin of the European component identified in Hungarian Conquerors are the Late Bronze Age Srubnaya culture, and its ancestors Potapovka and Poltavka. Very tight relationships were observed between the medieval Capidava population and these Bronze Age populations of steppe origin. These data suggest that the Pontic-Caspian steppe genetic input in Eastern Europe might not be solely restricted to the Carpathian Basin.",
            "This study provides new anthropological and genetic insights on a medieval group of individuals from southeastern Europe, collectively buried in a particular fashion that contrasts the typical Christian funerary rituals of this historical period as observed in the same necropolis. The unusual position of the human skeletal remains, associated pathologies, and the presence of traumatic injuries among the male individuals, point to interpersonal violence, poor life quality, and the careless treatment of the dead. The high diversity of mitochondrial haplogroups detected in the C58 archaeological complex (six individuals, six haplotypes) reflects the lack of close maternal relationships among individuals, and quite an intricate genetic history, as the identified subclades have diverse geographic distribution (Eurasia, Middle East, Southern Europe). The full length mitogenomic data reconstructed in this study enriches the available genetic information for the medieval period, particularly for Dobruja. All the existing mtDNA information on the medieval Capidava population provides further evidence for genetic connections to the Hungarian Conquerors, a Bronze Age population from the Balkans and Bronze Age populations of steppe origin (Srubnaya and Potapovka-Poltavka).",

All human remains belonging to ten individuals discussed in this paper have been transferred to a permanent collection deposited for research at the Molecular Biology Center, Interdisciplinary Research Institute on Bio-Nano Sciences, \u201cBabe\u0219-Bolyai\u201d University in Cluj-Napoca and carry the following codes: Cap-C58-1, Cap-C58-2, Cap-C58-3, Cap-C58-5, Cap-C58-6, Cap-C58-7, Cap-C58-9, Cap-C58-10, Cap-C58-11. The collection is open to researchers, upon request.",
            "A total number of 186 funerary units were discovered during the above mentioned archaeological excavations (sector X,extra muros, Information Center, Access way and Parking lot points), most of them being simple, quadrilateral inhumation graves that contain a single individual. With the exception of two Bronze Age individuals, the rest of them were dated to the medieval period based on funerary rituals, grave goods or subsequent radiocarbon dating. Peculiar for this necropolis is the presence of a circular multiple burial pit containing the skeletal remains of ten individuals which are the subject of this study (Supplementary Fig.S2). A direct radiocarbon dating was performed at Beta Analytic (Florida, USA), using the human osteological material retrieved from two graves, one containing a single individual showing signs of similar disregard towards the deceased (ventral decubitus), located in the proximity of the multiple burial (Cap-C143, Beta - 475779), and one from the multiple burial (Cap-C58-1, Beta \u2013 475778). Radiocarbon dating for a Capidava individual buried in a typical single grave (Cap-M4, B terrace) was previously published7and mentioned in the Results section. Details regarding the archaeological background and associated images can be found in the Supplementary Information.",
            "All bone fragments and dental samples recovered from the Capidava multiple burial were morphologically evaluated at the Interdisciplinary Research Institute on Bio-Nano Sciences, \u201cBabe\u0219-Bolyai\u201d University in Cluj-Napoca. The anthropological investigation was carried out at individual level in order to gather information on age at death, sex, traces of injuries, pathological conditions, and stress markers that can infer the demographic structure and epidemiological conditions of this group of medieval individuals. The osteological examination was performed using previously described standard guidelines13,38and the results are summarized in the Supplementary TableS1. The availability of dental specimens with good preservation status was an eliminatory sample selection criterion for ulterior molecular genetic investigations. Therefore, aDNA analysis was not attempted in case of four archaeological individuals (Cap C58-4, Cap C58-7, Cap-C58-10, and Cap-C58-11).",
            "Six specimens consisting of intact multi-rooted teeth (labeled as Cap-C58-1, Cap-C58-2, Cap-C58-3, Cap-C58-5, Cap-C58-6, and Cap-C58-9) were sampled and stored for genetic analysis during the archaeological excavation. All procedures leading to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) were performed in dedicated aDNA facilities of the Molecular Anthropology Laboratory, University of Florence. Standard criteria for the analysis of aDNA39were rigorously followed and strict precautionary measures were undertaken to avoid contamination with exogenous DNA. All experimental steps were implemented following the protocol described in detail by Modiet al.40and Tassiet al.41. In brief, each tooth sample was cleaned by mechanical abrasion of the surface using a dental micro-drill, followed by UV irradiation (254\u2009nm) for 45\u2009minutes, on each side. The powdered tissue used for the isolation of genetic material was obtained from the tooth roots using the same dental device at a very low rotation speed. For each sample, DNA was extracted from 50\u2009mg of biological material following a silica-based protocol, specially designed to target ultra-short molecules42. Illumina libraries were constructed using a previously developed protocol43. No enzymatic treatment for damage repair was applied in order to preserve and consequently analyze the degradation patterns of DNA fragments. The libraries were amplified to reach plateau and enriched for human mitochondrial DNA using a selective bead-capture approach by hybridization of aDNA with probes consisting of long-range PCR products14. A negative control was processed during all analytical phases to monitor for possible contamination. The enriched libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios with libraries from other samples and paired-end sequenced (2\u2009\u00d7\u200975\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u20098 cycles) using the Illumina MiSeq platform.",
            "To reconstruct the mitochondrial sequences we usedschmutzi, an iterative approach that jointly estimates present-day human contamination and assembles the endogenous mitochondrial genome15. Forward and reverse reads were merged into single sequences with a minimum overlap of 10\u2009bp between paired-end reads and the adapters were trimmed using SeqPrep44. Unmerged sequences and sequences shorter than 30\u2009bp were discarded. BWA45software package was used for mapping the filtered reads against the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS,NC_012920.146), applying recommended parameter settings for aDNA molecules \u201c\u2013l 1000 \u2013n 0.01 \u2013o 2\u201d. After removing PCR duplicates, only sequences with a map quality score \u226530 were retained and used to align at unique positions along the reference sequence. Consensus sequences for the mitochondrial genomes of all samples were called usingschmutzi(parameters: \u201c\u2013logindel 1\u2013uselength\u201d). DNA damage patterns at the ends of the molecules and average fragment length were taken into account to identify and call endogenous bases. Present-day human contamination estimates were performed using a non-redundant database of 197 human mitochondrial genomes available in the software package. Misincorporation patterns at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were computed using contDeam, a program provided withschmutzipackages. A summary of NGS data for each analyzed sample can be found in the Supplementary TableS2. Mitochondrial haplotypes for each sample were determined with the use of HaploGrep47, based on PhyloTree48build 17 (Supplementary TableS3). Consensus sequences corresponding to each medieval individual from Capidava were submitted to NCBI GenBank under the accession numbersMH298069-MH298074.",
            "The phylogenetic relationships of the six newly characterized mitogenomes and other modern and ancient published data were inferred from haplotype networks. For this purpose, we have searched in the available online databases and literature for sequences that correspond to the haplogroups identified in the Capidava multiple burial pit. All matching complete mtDNA sequences were downloaded from web depositories (NCBI Nucleotide, European Nucleotide Archive) or were requested from the authors (Supplementary TableS4). The haplogroup of all sequences was re-checked using HaploFind49and we grouped them according to their maternal lineage. All nucleotide sequence subsets were aligned with MAFFT version 750applying the progressive method G-INS-1. Multiple sequence alignments were converted into Nexus format files with MEGA51which were used to build median-joining networks in PopART52with default settings. The phylogeographic relations were inferred based on the geographic origin of the most similar sequences from literature.",
            "Another database of full-length mitochondrial sequences comprising 282 ancient samples from 17 relevant Eurasian populations was assembled from published literature (Supplementary TableS5) in order to evaluate the genetic similarities between them and the samples analyzed in this study. The samples were grouped according to their geographic and chronological affiliations. In cases where populations consisted of very low sample numbers, related neighboring groups were brought together, if possible. For this reason, the six Capidava samples analyzed in this study were clustered with previously described NGS medieval samples from the same archaeological site7under the \u201cRou-med\u201d umbrella. Pairwise population differentiation values (FST) were calculated from complete mtDNA genomes using the Arlequin 3.5.2.2 software53. Nucleotide positions showing point indels (309.1\u2009C(C), 315.1\u2009C, AC indels at 515\u2013522, A16182c, A16183c, and 16193.1\u2009C(C)) were excluded from the analysis as they can cause difficulties when multiple mtDNA genomes are aligned. The most appropriate nucleotide substitution model and the estimate of gamma parameter were determined with jModeltest 2.1.10.54,55. The FSTvalues of the ancient dataset were computed assuming a Tamura & Nei56substitution model, 10000 permutations for p-value calculation and an allowed level of missing data of 0.05. The matrix of Slatkin FSTvalues (Supplementary TableS6) was displayed on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot represented in a two-dimensional space (Fig.8) using metaMDS function based on Euclidean distances implemented in the vegan library57of R 3.3.258. The FSTvalues were also represented by different color shadings to indicate the degree of similarity or dissimilarity of the ROU-med population to the ancient Eurasian populations and visualized on a geographic map (Fig.7).",

            "Historical records document medieval immigration from North Africa to Iberia to create Islamic al-Andalus. Here, we present a low-coverage genome of an eleventh century CE man buried in an Islamic necropolis in Segorbe, near Valencia, Spain. Uniparental lineages indicate North African ancestry, but at the autosomal level he displays a mosaic of North African and European-like ancestries, distinct from any present-day population. Altogether, the genome-wide evidence, stable isotope results and the age of the burial indicate that his ancestry was ultimately a result of admixture between recently arrived Amazigh people (Berbers) and the population inhabiting the Peninsula prior to the Islamic conquest. We detect differences between our sample and a previously published group of contemporary individuals from Valencia, exemplifying how detailed, small-scale aDNA studies can illuminate fine-grained regional and temporal differences. His genome demonstrates how ancient DNA studies can capture portraits of past genetic variation that have been erased by later demographic shifts\u2014in this case, most likely the seventeenth century CE expulsion of formerly Islamic communities as tolerance dissipated following theReconquistaby the Catholic kingdoms of the north.",
            "Subject terms:Anthropology, Archaeology, Evolutionary genetics, Population genetics",
            "The location of Iberia, bridging the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, and its proximity to Africa, has allowed contacts with populations of distinct ancestries over time, making the Peninsula a genetic and cultural crossroads. There is both archaeological and direct genetic evidence of contacts between Iberia and North African populations since at least the Late Neolithic1\u20136, and possibly as early as the postglacial period7,8. Prehistoric populations have been the focus of most of the ancient DNA (aDNA) work published on Iberia so far, including the study of Mesolithic individuals9,10, the impact of Neolithic dispersals11,12, and the incursions of individuals with Steppe-related ancestry at the time of the transition from the Chalcolithic to the Bronze Age5,6,13\u201315.",
            "aDNA researchers have recently begun to explore in detail historical intervals of known population movements6. Although Iberia intensified contacts with North Africa through Phoenician traders, Carthaginians and Roman conquerors16, North-African genetic contribution seems to have been restricted to southern populations until the eight century CE6. It is only with the Islamic conquest of Iberia in 711 CE that records start pointing towards a substantial influx of people from North Africa, involving the culturally and genetically differentiated Arab and Amazigh (Berber) peoples17,18. Attempts have been made to estimate their contribution to the genetic landscape of medieval Iberia using modern genomes, revealing a faint southwest-northeast pattern of decreasing North African-related ancestry19,20, which have recently been confirmed by means of aDNA analysis6.",
            "Although Arabs were the urban and political elite during the Umayyad Caliphate, ruling from 711 CE until the end of the Caliphate of Cordoba in 1031 CE, they are thought to have been a minority amongst the new settlers. Berbers formed the bulk of the army who first seized Visigothic Spain in the eighth century CE21. Berbers had converted to Islam as a result of the Arab conquest of North Africa in the preceding century and embarked in a slow and complex process of Arabisation that lasted centuries. However, they were far from culturally homogeneous; a deep division existed between nomadic and sedentary Berber groups, and it was the latter who first settled in the rural areas of Spain18. Although Berber numbers in Iberia were likely larger than those of the Arabs, they initially wielded no significant political power, but this changed during the eleventh\u2013thirteenth centuries CE with the establishment of the Almoravid and Almohad Berber empires18.",
            "After the southwards military expansion of the Catholic kingdoms ended in 1492, a large population ofMoriscos(Muslims forcibly converted to Christianity) persisted in East Iberia (previously Sharq al-Andalus) until 1609 CE, when at least one third of the populace was forcibly expelled by the Spanish Crown and relocated to North Africa22. Historical documentation suggests that the population of the eastern Mediterranean provinces of Castell\u00f3n, Valencia, Alicante, and\u2014to a lesser degree\u2014Murcia and parts of Andalusia (Almeria and Granada), was greatly reduced, with subsequent resettlement from Aragon, Catalonia and Navarre to avoid economic and demographic collapse23. Many surnames currently widespread in the Valencian region are geographically structured and reflect their provenance from the colonizing regions (data from Spanish National Institute of Statistics, 2017; Supplementary Fig.S1). The hinterland was mostly repopulated by non-Catalan-speaking Aragonese, whereas the main coastal cities concentrated more Catalan-speakers from Catalonia23. This divide is thought to be still reflected in the genomic data today20. Thus, most of the existing genetic variation from the preceding eastern Iberian populations and the North African genetic variation potentially brought during Islamic rule had most likely disappeared by the late seventeenth century CE20, especially in the Valencian region24. Therefore, DNA from archaeological remains can provide an important tool to understand the demographic dynamics of the Islamic period in East Iberia25.",
            "Here, we sequenced the genome of an individual (UE2298/MS060) who was buried in the Islamicmaqbara(necropolis) of Plaza del Almud\u00edn in the city of Segorbe (province of Castell\u00f3n, Comunidad Valenciana, Spain) (Supplementary Fig.S2). He was dubbed as \u201cthe Giant\u201d by the archaeologists responsible for the excavation (here referred to as the \u201cSegorbe Giant\u201d), due to his unusual height (184\u2013190\u00a0cm) compared with the other individuals found in the site (Barrachina 2004) (Supplementary Methods). Osteological assessment suggests that he had African ancestry, and he was postulated to be of possible Berber origin26,27. Although his uniparental lineages point to North African ancestry, at the autosomal level he displays both North African and European-related ancestries. The genetic analyses show differences in relation to contemporary individuals from Valencia6and highlight the contribution of admixture between people of North African origin and the populations inhabiting East Iberia prior to the Islamic period. We conducted a complementary analysis of stable isotopes on a total of thirteen individuals from the necropolis (Supplementary TableS1) to investigate mobility and diet patterns. We also generated more than 1000 new modern Iberian whole mitochondrial genomes to assess the potential impact of North African mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages in the modern Iberian maternal gene pool. As UE2298/MS060 belongs to mtDNA haplogroup U6, we also performed a detailed phylogeographic reanalysis of this haplogroup.",
            "We confirmed that the individual was genetically male (RY>\u20090.077; Supplementary Fig.S3), and both his uniparental markers point towards North African origins (Supplementary TableS2). He belongs to mtDNA haplogroup U6a1a1a (nomenclature according to Hern\u00e1ndez et al.28). Although U6 in general, and U6a in particular, is present in higher frequencies in North and West Africa29,30, the complete mitochondrial genome dataset currently available is heavily biased towards Europe, and U6a1a1a, which dates to 3.5 thousand years ago (ka) (maximum-likelihood node estimation based on modern variation), appears to have a more southern European distribution (Fig.1a; Supplementary Fig.S4). However, in our Iberian mitogenome dataset, U6a1a1a occurs only at 0.3%, whereas the HVS-I (hypervariable segment I) subclade U6a1a1, defined by a transition variant at position 16239, which nests U6a1a1a, is found at\u2009~\u200914% in Algerian Mozabite Berbers31.",

Although U6 lineages have been retrieved from sixteenth century CE Islamic burials in Granada (Andalusia)6, to our knowledge, UE2298/MS060 (dating to the eleventh century CE) is the earliest documented finding of a U6 lineage in Iberia. Based on the results of our newly generated Iberian mitochondrial dataset (n=\u20091104: 1008 sequences from mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands, plus 96 from mainland Portugal), U6a can be found at a frequency of 1.6% in modern mainland Iberian populations, with a peak of 3.6% in the south of Spain (Fig.1b). This pattern contrasts with most mitochondrial lineages today in Iberia, although a peak of frequency in the south of the Peninsula is also observed for typically sub-Saharan African L lineages (but not for the predominantly northeast African haplogroup M136) (Supplementary Fig.S5; Supplementary TableS5). UE2298/MS060 falls outside the modern geographic distribution of U6 lineages in Spain, suggesting that the present distribution might not reflect the medieval distribution of this haplogroup.

However, considering the genetic heterogeneity in different regions of Iberia through time, and given the complex history of population interactions in Iberia during the first millennium CE16,18, it is unlikely that UE2298/MS060 descends directly from Andalusian Visigothic populations and therefore we also explored 2-way admixture scenarios.

Application of a Bayesian mixing model (BMM), FRUITS (Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals)49, supports the observation that C4plants likely played a substantial part in the diet of some individuals and that marine fish consumption was variable (Supplementary Fig.S11). UE2298/MS060 (Fig.5c) seems to have consumed limited amounts of C4-plants (mean: 11.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5% or 4.8\u201317.9% of the diet) and marine protein (mean: 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4% or 0\u20134.8% of the diet) compared to the rest of the population analysed.

The subsequent anthropological analysis suggested some African morphological features and a link was postulated to the Berber-speaking populations that settled in the region in medieval times26,27.",
            "Analysis of the uniparental markers from UE2298/MS060 fits well with this assumption, pointing to an origin in the Maghreb, most likely from a Berber group. MtDNA lineage U6a is not only connected to modern Amazigh populations30, but has also been found in Moroccan remains associated with Iberomaurusian culture, and in the Moroccan Early Neolithic site of Ifri n\u2019Amr or Moussa2,32(Fig.1b). He also carries the Y-chromosome E1b1b1b1 (E\u2013M310) lineage. E1b1b is extremely common amongst extant North Africans and has been found in ancient North African and Levantine remains2,32,33,37(Supplementary Fig.S7). Due to low coverage, we could only assign him to a basal position within E1b1b1b1, but it is possible that he may belong to a more derived subclade. One possibility would be E1b1b1b1a (E\u2013M81), which is the most common haplogroup amongst modern Berber males today42,53, and has been linked to Islamic remains in southern France38. Another would be its descendant E1b1b1b1a1-M183 lineage, identified in three Guanche males, in two Islamic individuals from Granada, and in an earlier sixth century CE male from the Visigoth phase of Pla de l'Horta, in Catalonia6,33.",
            "Although he carries both uniparental markers of North African origin, autosomal evidence paints a more complex picture. The individual is positioned in the PCA mid-way between modern/ancient Iberian populations, and Late Neolithic Moroccan, Guanches and modern North African individuals (Fig.3a), and formal tests of admixture point to high proportions of\u00a0Iberian-like ancestry (Fig.4; Supplementary TableS7).",
            "Considering the archaeological and historical records for this period in the region of Valencia, we envisage three possible scenarios to explain the observed ancestry in UE2298/MS060. One would be to assume that this individual is a direct migrant from North Africa (whose unique genetic composition has not yet been examined using aDNA), or derives from a population that moved into Iberia but retained its genetic identity. A second scenario is that he descends from pre-Islamic Iberian genetic diversity. Finally, the third scenario is that he is the result of admixture between Iberian and North African sources.",
            "The first scenario would imply that pre-Islamic populations in North Africa would be genetically similar to UE2298/MS060 (or possibly to other contemporary individuals found in Spain6). The nearest temporal proxy available are the Guanches (from the seventh\u2013eleventh centuries CE), who originated in the Maghreb but have been isolated in the Canary Islands since at least the early Iron Age.D-statistics, however, suggest that UE2298/MS060 is genetically closer toMorocco_LNthan to theGuanches(Supplementary TableS7). In any case,qpAdmrejects the hypothesis that UE2298/MS060 directly descends from a population resembling either theGuanchesorMorocco_LN(Supplementary TableS8). Additionally, the oxygen data for UE2298/MS060 (Supplementary Note 2) is consistent with someone who grew up in the region, and points towards low mobility between early childhood and adolescence. (In contrast, another individual from the same necropolis (MS075) does look non-local (Supplementary Note 2), possibly a migrant from a warmer climate outside the Mediterranean, with oxygen values similar to those of Africa or the Near East48). Nevertheless, one should note that aDNA sampling in North Africa is sparse and limited to a few individuals from very specific sites and periods, and we cannot rule out that a population with a similar genetic composition to that of UE2298/MS060 existed in the region around this period.",
            "Although North African-related ancestry in present-day Spain is present at low values (typically\u2009~\u20093\u20138%), with a slight southwest-to-northeast decline19,20, increased African-related ancestry has been present in south Spain since the third century CE6. This North African influence is captured in ourqpAdmanalysis, with 1-way models using pre-Islamic Andalusian populations being accepted (Supplementary TableS8). However, it is unlikely that UE2298/MS060 descends directly from Andalusian Visigothic populations and ultimately these models, despite being\u00a0statistically plausible, do not fully explain the ancestry of our individual. We note that there are no data available from or around the region of Valencia between the end of the Iron Age and the Islamic period, and post-Iron-Age genetic variation in Spain was most likely very heterogeneous across locations and centuries6. This heterogeneity is confirmed by our results showing that UE2298/MS060 forms a clade withIslamic_Andalusia, but not withIslamic_Valencia(Supplementary TableS8).",
            "The third scenario would be that the genetic variation seen in UE2298/MS060 was a result of admixture between Amazigh people who migrated from North Africa to Iberia, and the local population inhabiting the Peninsula, at some point during either the Islamic conquest, the Caliphate period, or the Berber empires. This would explain UE2298/MS060's intermediate position in the PCA and ternary plot (supervised ADMIXTURE) (Fig.3).D-statistics support this scenario, with tests comparing Morocco Late Neolithic and Iberian populations from different periods not showing him to be significantly closer to one or the other (Fig.4; Supplementary TableS7). We show that UE2298/MS060 can be modelled as admixture between Iberian and North African sources (either the Guanches from the Canary Islands or Late Neolithic Moroccans) (Table1). The fact that he still carried both uniparental markers of North African origin suggests that the admixture may have happened only a few generations before his time, coinciding with the zenith of Berber power, rather than earlier during the conquest, in agreement with admixture dates inferred from modern Iberian genomes from Aragon and Catalonia20. However, we cannot rule out assortative mating, allowing these uniparental markers to be retained for longer, or the possibility that these lineages were common in some Iberian populations before the Islamic period. The date of the burial (eleventh century CE)27fits the historical narrative of Berber settlement in the region of Sharq al-Andalus18. Considering the genetic evidence, together with the stable isotope results and the historical accounts of intermarriage between local individuals and the North African newcomers, and in agreement with recent aDNA evidence from Iberia6, this third scenario seems the most plausible to explain the ancestry patterns seen in his genome.",
            "Nevertheless, the original source populations are difficult to pinpoint. Due to lack of sampling in North Africa for this specific period and preceding centuries, the nearest proxies available for the North African source are the Guanches33and the Late Neolithic Moroccan population from Kelif el Boroud site2. There is high differentiation between present-day North African populations and ancient North African individuals available to date (seen in PC3; Supplementary Fig.S9), which indicates that important population dynamics occurring after the Late Neolithic and/or Iron Age shaped extant genetic structure in the region. Modern North African populations show a signal of increased Levantine-related ancestry around the seventh century CE, as a result of movements from the Near East during the Islamic expansion into North Africa17; the impact of these movements was also seen in the Levant, as shown by the study of seventh\u2013eighth century Islamic individuals in Syria54. Therefore, the North-African source of UE2298/MS060 might have already displayed this increased Near Eastern-related ancestry. Similarly, the population of Valencia in the immediately preceding centuries has yet to be studied.",
            "A study in modern South Americans detected North African ancestry introduced at the early stages of European colonization55. The presence of individuals in medieval Spain with a genetic background similar to that of UE2298/MS060 would explain the source of this ancestry in America, suggesting that admixture with North Africans had a wider impact on medieval Spanish genetic variation, before virtually disappearing in the following centuries.",
            "We found no U6 in our present-day whole-mtDNA dataset from the region of Valencia (n=\u200954), or in a larger previously published HVS-I database (n=\u2009123)56. This absence might be an echo of the brutality of the decree of expulsion ofMoriscos(Muslims forcibly converted to Christianity), which may have effectively erased the population carrying North African-related ancestry that lived in the region in the preceding centuries. They were replaced by settlers from regions further north with little North African-related ancestry20. This is in sharp contrast with regions of the Crown of Castilla, where historical sources claim there was better integration of theMoriscoidentity into the general population, and where no mass deportations were recorded: the frequency of U6, M1 and L lineages are higher in these regions today (present-day central and south Spain) (Fig.1b; Supplementary Fig.S5). This pattern is also visible at the genome-wide level20.",
            "This study emphasises the importance of immigration during the Islamic period. In contrast to Andalusia, the region of Valencia is not geographically close to the Maghreb, and was under Islamic rule for a shorter time, but nonetheless developed strong links with the Arab\u2013Berber world during the Islamic period57. A contemporary individual, MS075, is evidence of continued\u00a0movement during Berber rule (Supplementary Note 2).",
            "UE2298/MS060 is a single, low-coverage sample and although the results cannot be extrapolated to the population as a whole, recently published results6show a similar trend of admixture in Islamic Spain. The heterogeneity of genomic patterns that is now being uncovered by aDNA studies emphasises the need for much more detailed, high-resolution fine-scale studies. More individuals and a wider diversity of sites across the Peninsula should be studied to explore the population dynamics during the Islamic period in more detail and assess potential fine differences between geographical regions and periods, and between urban and rural societies.",
            "We collected teeth from thirteen individuals from the medieval Islamic necropolis of Plaza del Almud\u00edn in Segorbe27(province of Castell\u00f3n, Spain) (Supplementary Fig.S2; Supplementary TableS1).

            "Ancient DNA facilitates the return of remains to Indigenous tribal groups, resolving a long-standing concern.",
            "After European colonization, the ancestral remains of Indigenous people were often collected for scientific research or display in museum collections. For many decades, Indigenous people, including Native Americans and Aboriginal Australians, have fought for their return. However, many of these remains have no recorded provenance, making their repatriation very difficult or impossible. To determine whether DNA-based methods could resolve this important problem, we sequenced 10 nuclear genomes and 27 mitogenomes from ancient pre-European Aboriginal Australians (up to 1540 years before the present) of known provenance and compared them to 100 high-coverage contemporary Aboriginal Australian genomes, also of known provenance. We report substantial ancient population structure showing strong genetic affinities between ancient and contemporary Aboriginal Australian individuals from the same geographic location. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of successfully identifying the origins of unprovenanced ancestral remains using genomic methods.",
            "European colonization has had widespread effects on Indigenous peoples throughout the world. Dispossessed of their land and forcibly dispersed, their traditional ways of life were disrupted, and the survival of their culture and language was threatened (1). This dispossession has often included ancestral human remains that were taken from their resting places and distributed throughout the world. This is true of Native North Americans and Aboriginal Australians, the latter being one of the oldest continuous cultures outside Africa. Since the arrival of the British First Fleet to Australia in 1788, many ancestral remains of Aboriginal Australians have been collected for scientific research or display in museum collections (1,2). In addition to the confiscation of ancestral remains, Aboriginal Australian children were often removed from their families and placed into institutions or with European families. These children, many of whom are now adults, are commonly referred to as the \u201cStolen Generation.\u201d As a consequence, many of these Aboriginal Australians have lost their connections to Place and Country (1).",
            "Over many decades, there has been a concerted effort by Aboriginal Australians to reach agreement with museums that would enable their ancestral remains to be returned to the original communities from which they were taken (3\u20137). This issue is of particular importance to Aboriginal Australians given their spiritual connection to the place in which they were born and lived (8). Many Aboriginal Australians believe that in order for their ancestor\u2019s spirits to rest, their remains must be returned to their ancestral lands and their kin after death (3). For Aboriginal Australians, this is termed return to \u201cPlace and Country.\u201d",
            "Unfortunately, many of these remains have no specific details regarding their geographic origin, tribal affiliation, or language group (9,10). For many, the only information provided is that these remains are \u201cAboriginal Australian\u201d in origin. This lack of detailed information regarding their provenance means that many remains are unable to be returned. Museums and other institutions are unable to repatriate remains without first identifying the appropriate communities or custodians (2). Notably, this problem is not limited to Aboriginal Australians but is a worldwide issue affecting almost all Indigenous groups.",
            "Recent advances in ancient DNA methods and bioinformatics suggest that a genomic approach can be successfully used to facilitate, on a large scale, the identification of unprovenanced remains. The success of such an approach has been illustrated by the identification and subsequent repatriation of the 8500-year-old Native American remains of \u201cKennewick Man\u201d (11). To date, there have been a limited number of genomic studies of ancient Aboriginal Australians with only two focused on pre-European (12,13) and two focused on post-European remains (14,15).",
            "The first ancient DNA study of Aboriginal Australians, published in 2001, reported the recovery of 10 short mitochondrial sequences (12). However, a later genomic study of the same ancient remains established that the earlier sequences were likely polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts (13). The latter study reported the recovery of the complete mitogenome of an ancient Aboriginal Australian (labeled WLH4) (13). This was the first example of the recovery of authentic human DNA from an Australian archeological context, proving that it was possible to successfully recover ancient DNA, despite the harsh Australian climatic conditions and resulting poor DNA preservation. However, the recovery of the ancient nuclear genomes of Australia\u2019s First People has been to date elusive.",
            "In collaboration with Aboriginal Australian Traditional Owners and communities across Australia, we undertook ancient DNA analyses of 27 sets of remains from archeological excavations of known Aboriginal Australian burial sites or previously repatriated remains of known provenance. The distinction between Aboriginal Australian genomes from pre- and post-European contact periods is important for the determination of the provenance of remains. This is because the resulting admixture can confound the determination of provenance (16). The ages of the skeletal remains of the ancient Aboriginal Australians studied here were determined from either archeological or14C dates (Supplementary Materials). Different regions of Australia were settled by Europeans at different times. However, all of the ages of ancient samples pre-date European contact, thus excluding the possibility of admixture. This distinction is further supported by the presence of morphological and pathological characteristics including the absence of dental caries and distinctive tooth wear patterns typical of hunter-gatherer diets (17). The hair samples used were from individuals born before European settlement of the geographic regions sampled (table S1 and Supplementary Text).",
            "Using DNA in-solution capture methods and second-generation sequencing, we successfully recovered 10 ancient nuclear genomes (0.3\u00d7 to 6.9\u00d7 coverage) and 27 mitogenomes (2.3\u00d7 to 321\u00d7 coverage) from pre-European contact remains of Aboriginal Australians (dated 95 to 1540 years before the present). In addition, for four of the male ancient Aboriginal Australians (KP1, MH8, PA86, and WLH4), we were able to recover partial or complete Y-chromosome sequences (haplogroups S1a and S1c). Preliminary shotgun sequencing showed that many of the ancient samples had very low levels of endogenous DNA (table S2). We therefore designed and used a modified method that used whole-genome capture baits (myBaits) to enrich targeted nuclear sequences. We found that, by modifying the hybridization temperature to 57\u00b0C, the genome coverage obtained was significantly enhanced.",
            "All recovered ancient sequences exhibited damage patterns characteristic of ancient DNA, with elevated levels of cytosine to thymine misincorporations in the 5\u2032 end of fragments and guanine to adenine misincorporations in the 3\u2032 end (Materials and Methods). In addition, contamination estimates for both mitochondrial and genome-wide sequences all displayed low contamination levels (Materials and Methods).",
            "We used the recovered ancient Aboriginal Australian mitogenomes and nuclear genomes as proxies for unprovenanced remains to determine whether we could accurately identify their geographic origins using DNA-based methods. While we successfully recovered four partial or complete Y chromosomes from ancient male Aboriginal Australians, previous research on contemporary Aboriginal Australian males (16,18,19) has shown considerable levels of Eurasian admixture, with large numbers of research participants carrying non-Indigenous Y-chromosome haplotypes. The level of Eurasian admixture observed in contemporary Aboriginal Australian males varies greatly, with between ~32 and ~70% being observed in different regions of Australia (16,18,19). Undeniably, there has been a significant loss of Aboriginal Australian Y-chromosome genetic diversity since European settlement, perhaps with entire lineages lost to the past. This Y-chromosome admixture makes it extremely difficult to obtain a clear picture of the paternal genomic history of Aboriginal Australians and, as such, would hinder attempts to find possible ancestral connections for repatriation purposes.",
            "We constructed comparative contemporary mitochondrial and nuclear DNA datasets based on self-reported language group affiliations (16,20), as well as geographic locations (Fig. 1). The contemporary nuclear DNA dataset comprised 100 high-coverage nuclear genomes of Pama-Nyungan language\u2013speaking Aboriginal Australians. A total of 112 mitogenomes showing Aboriginal Australian\u2013specific mitochondrial haplogroups were included in the mitochondrial DNA analyses, including 17 previously published genomes (table S3) (14,21,22).",
            "",

Dashed lines show the approximate distribution of accepted major language subgroups as published in (20) with language names in italics. Red symbols indicate previously published mitochondrial or nuclear genomes; blue symbols indicate new unpublished data. Circles indicate contemporary Aboriginal Australian samples, and stars represent ancient individuals. Sample code abbreviations have been included in parentheses.",
            "As these contemporary datasets were assembled for the purpose of repatriation, they required a high degree of accuracy. Therefore, only previously published contemporary DNA sequences of known geographic origin and/or language group were used (14,16,21,22). The recent publication of 111 mitogenomes recovered from historic hair samples from locations in Queensland and South Australia was not included, as the deposited sequences lacked precise geographic identifiers (15).",
            "Using mitochondrial maximum likelihood phylogenetics (fig. S2), we compared 29 ancient Aboriginal Australian mitogenomes (14) with the 112 contemporary mitogenomes we previously assembled (Fig. 2). We observed 38 distinct mitochondrial haplogroups, with novel subclades discovered within mitochondrial haplotypes M42c *, R12a *, R12b *, and M42a3, while new subtypes were found for most other mitochondrial haplotypes (Supplementary Materials). For 18 ancient Aboriginal Australian individuals (62.1%), the closest contemporary match was an individual from the same geographic region (within 235 km). Within this group, nine ancient individuals could be matched to a contemporary individual within 100 km, and six could be matched to individuals from the exact location from which the ancient remains originated (Fig. 1).",
            "",
            "Mitochondrial maximum likelihood phylogenetic relationships among ancient subgroups (bold) and contemporary Aboriginal Australians are shown. Colored segments indicate separate mitochondrial haplogroups.",
            "For the remaining 11 ancient individuals (37.9%), the results were either inconclusive due to a lack of contemporary matches or because some mitochondrial haplotypes were geographically widespread. It has been previously documented that some Aboriginal Australian mitochondrial haplotypes have widespread distributions across the continent, while others are regional specific (15,16,23\u201325), reflecting ancient female migration patterns. While this is an interesting anthropological finding and may potentially inform the time depth of these practices, it is less helpful for repatriation. In two instances (6.9%), the closest ancient mitochondrial matches were not from the same geographic locations. In this case, the closest contemporary matches were individuals from opposite sides of Cape York Peninsula, some 635 km away (Fig. 1). As the return to Place and Country of ancestral remains is of paramount importance to many Aboriginal Australian communities, repatriation to an incorrect Country would be problematic. Therefore, the use of mitochondrial DNA alone is not recommended for repatriation.",
            "Subsequently, we performed a series of analyses on the 10 ancient Aboriginal Australian nuclear genomes recovered. To investigate the overall genetic structure of ancient and contemporary Aboriginal Australian populations, we analyzed the individuals in the context of a reference panel including 2117 modern individuals from worldwide populations genotyped for 593,610 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (26,27). Principal components analysis (PCA) and supervised model-based clustering (ADMIXTURE) revealed high levels of recent admixture across many Aboriginal groups, particularly those from Bourke (BKM) and Willandra Lakes (WIL) (Fig. 3). While most of the recent admixture is European in origin, we also observed evidence of East Asian gene flow, particularly among individuals from North Queensland (CAI and WPA). In contrast, individuals from the Western Central Desert (WCD) were almost completely unadmixed and were therefore subsequently used as a reference group for Aboriginal Australian ancestry in local admixture inference and masking, using previously described methods (16). All of the ancient Aboriginal Australian samples were found to cluster close to the unadmixed WCD individuals (without apparent European admixture), as expected.",

            "(A) First two principal components of a PCA of individuals from non-African populations, with ancient individuals (black outlines) projected. (B) Supervised admixture of contemporary Australians using five putative ancestry sources. Many modern Australians show evidence for European (French; orange stars) or East Asian (Han; blue diamonds) admixture. All ancient individuals cluster tightly with previously described Australian Aboriginals without recent admixture (WCD).",
            "We investigated the genetic relationships among the ancient Aboriginal Australian individuals using both PCA and outgroupf3statistics. These analyses revealed substantial genetic structure between individuals from different geographic regions, with three distinct clades observed (Fig. 4, A and B). To further characterize their relationships, we fitted the highest-coverage ancient individual from each region onto an admixture graph using qpGraph (Fig. 5). We found that the deepest divergence separated the ancient individual from Kalgoorlie/Golden Ridge (ANC) from all remaining individuals. Within the eastern clade, we identified a trifurcation among the three major geographic regions (Fig. 5) without any apparent closer relationship between the groups from north-western (MH8 and WPAH4) and north-eastern Queensland (PA86) with respect to the individuals from New South Wales (WLH4 and KP1) (Fig. 5). Notably, we detected ~13% Papuan-related ancestry in the individual from Cairns (PA86). This was also observed for contemporary individuals from the same region (20).",

Polygons and large symbols indicate the range and median of the principal components for each modern population, respectively. (B) Multidimensional scaling based on pairwise genetic drift sharing (outgroupf3statistics) between ancient individuals and modern populations (using masked data). The results highlight the considerable genetic structure among ancient Aboriginal Australians. In both analyses, modern individuals show closest affinities with ancient individuals from the same geographic region.",
            "",
            "Three admixture graph models for Aboriginal Australians including each major regional group (represented by the respective highest-coverage ancient individual) are shown. While all three models fit the data with |Z| < 3 (worstfstatistic indicated below each graph), only the topology where individuals from north-western Queensland (WPAH4 and MH8) form an outgroup to north-eastern Queensland (PA86) and New South Wales (KP1 and WLH4) (left panel) results in no trifurcation (branches with length zero highlighted in red in the other two topologies). Individual PA86 is fit as a mixture with 13 to 15% of Papuan-related ancestry in all three models.",
            "We next sought to determine whether the ancient Aboriginal Australian individuals were most closely related to the individuals with known traditional connection to the same region, thereby facilitating repatriation. Genetic clustering using PCA or outgroupf3statistics both suggested a higher genetic affinity of the ancient individuals to local contemporary groups, compared to contemporary Aboriginal Australians from other geographic locations (Fig. 4). We further investigated these patterns usingf4statistics in the form off4(Mbuti,Ancient;Contemporary,Papuan) on the masked dataset. This measured the amount of excess allele sharing of an ancient Aboriginal Australian individual with a given contemporary group when compared to Papuans. We found that the local contemporary groups consistently showed the highest level of sharing with the respective ancient Aboriginal Australian individual, supporting long-term local population continuity (Fig. 6). This finding is in concordance with previous studies of Aboriginal Australian skeletal remains (28,29). For the two higher-coverage ancient Aboriginal Australian individuals (KP1 and MH8), we additionally carried out haplotype sharing analyses. As previously supported with the allele frequency\u2013based results, the largest excess haplotype sharing for both KP1 and MH8 was also with the local contemporary group (fig. S8).",
            "",
            "Each panel showsf4statistics of the formf4(Mbuti,Ancient;Modern,Papuan). Negative values indicate the amount of excess allele sharing of the respective ancient individual with a contemporary Australian group (yaxis) compared to Papuans (masked dataset). Error bars show three SEs obtained from a block jackknife. Contemporary groups are sorted according to the amount of excess allele sharing in each panel. Notably, ancient individuals show the highest amount of sharing with their respective local contemporary group.",
            "Our analyses of the first ancient nuclear genomes of Aboriginal Australians reveal substantial past population structure. This result confirms the previous identification of an east versus west genetic divide between the contemporary Australian populations (16) while, at the same time, revealing further major geographic subdivision. When combined with the strong genomic affinities observed among ancient and contemporary populations from the same geographic locations, we showed that we could use these findings to reliably repatriate ancient unprovenanced remains to the correct Place and Country.",
            "Over a long period, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome sequences have proved to be highly informative genetic markers for a diverse array of applications. This includes phylogenetic reconstruction, timing of divergent events, and tracing the spread of humans worldwide (30). Some researchers, as a result of a biogeographic study of mitochondrial DNA diversity (15), have proposed that these genetic marker sequences can be used to facilitate repatriation. However, in contrast, one of the major findings of the current study is that mitochondrial DNA sequence variation performs poorly in this regard. Our results suggest that mitochondrial sequences, if used in repatriation efforts in the Australian context, would result in a significant percentage (~7%) of remains being returned to the wrong Indigenous group.",
            "We show that even under the arid conditions of Australia, low-coverage nuclear genomes can be recovered, and more importantly, these low coverage genomes can be used to precisely and accurately repatriate ancient remains. Furthermore, with advances in DNA capture and recovery methods, as well as with improvements in SNP analyses and the decreasing costs of genome sequencing, this general approach is likely to become more affordable and effective over time. We propose that our approach can be used now and will be used routinely in the future to return remains to their rightful kin. This approach could also allow for the identification of Place for members of the Stolen Generation. Because of the colonial history of removing children from their families, these people have lost not only their links to but also any knowledge of the location of their Country.",
            "Our findings also suggest that a similar approach could be used to facilitate the repatriation of Indigenous remains in other countries with a known ancient population history and a contemporary database. This would represent a major scientific and social advance.",
            "All pre-PCR procedures were carried out in a dedicated Ancient DNA facility in the Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, Griffith University. The facility is sealed, geographically isolated from any modern molecular laboratory, and has one-way airflow under positive pressure, and the air is high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)\u2013filtered. The skeletal remains and hair samples were processed within an ultraviolet-sterilized ultralow particulate air (ULPA)\u2013filtered vertical laminar flow cabinet (used for this purpose only). Each sample was initially treated with 10% bleach to remove any surface contaminants and then washed with UltraPure DNase/RNase-Free Distilled Water (Invitrogen) to remove any remaining bleach.",
            "Skeletal material was processed using a Dremel rotary tool with a high-speed diamond cutter head or manually with a sterilized scalpel blade, where the outer surface was discarded. DNA was extracted from ~50 mg of bone or tooth powder, as previously described (13). Extraction blanks were included throughout all procedures. Hair samples were processed in 2 to 4 ml of digestion buffer, as previously described (14). This solution was incubated in a rotating incubator oven for 24 hours at 45\u00b0C. After complete digestion, the samples were centrifuged at 9000gfor 3 min. The supernatant was combined with 10\u00d7 volume of a modified binding buffer [500 ml of buffer PB (phosphate buffer; Qiagen), 1:250 pH indicator I, 15 ml of 3 M NaOAC (pH 5.2), and 1.25 ml of NaCl]. Extractions were purified using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and eluted using 100 \u03bcl of buffer EB (elution buffer; Qiagen) after incubation for 10 min at 37\u00b0C.",

Libraries built from different samples were amplified using different polymerases (table S2). All libraries were screened on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) to ensure that the DNA length distributions did not show any significant artifacts from amplification, e.g., artificially long molecules due to serial binding or primer dimers. Where these problems occurred, the number of PCR amplification cycles or primer concentration was adjusted. All PCR and extraction blanks were screened for contaminant library constructs on the Bioanalyzer.",

DNA libraries were subjected to custom myBaits whole\u2013human genome capture (Arbor Biotechnologies). Target capture enrichment was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; however, hybridization was performed for 36 to 42 hours at 55\u00b0 to 57\u00b0C. The bead-binding buffers, initial 30-min incubation, and cleaning steps were also performed at this chosen hybridization temperature. Postcapture libraries were amplified on binding beads using the Kapa HiFi Uracil+ kit (Kapa Biosystems) according to the myBaits manual (version 3) for between 14 and 17 cycles.",

            "Genotyping of newly sequenced as well as previously reported modern individuals was carried out using SAMtools/bcftools (35), followed by filtering, as previously described (44). Briefly, per-individual diploid genotypes were called using SAMtools mpileup (-C50 option) and bcftools call with the consensus caller (-c option). Calls from each genome were then filtered, excluding calls with low (six reads or one-third of the average sequencing depth, whichever was higher) or high (>2 times the average depth) coverage. We further filtered variants called within 5 base pairs of each other, with a Phred posterior probability of < 30 or a strand bias or end distance biasPvalue of <104, or with deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with aPvalue of <104across all samples.",
            "For population genetic analyses, those genotypes were merged with a reference panel of 2286 modern individuals from worldwide populations, genotyped at 593,610 SNPs using the Affymetrix Human Origins array (26,27). All ancient individuals were represented by pseudo-haploid genotypes obtained by sampling a random allele at each SNP position. For the two ancient samples with higher coverage, KP1 (6.9\u00d7) and MH8 (6.8\u00d7), we also carried out diploid genotyping, as described above, to be used in the haplotype sharing analyses.",
            "PCA was carried out using smartpca (45) by projecting ancient individuals onto the components inferred from modern individuals using the \u201clsqproject\u201d option. Genetic affinities of ancient and modern individuals were investigated using thef-statistic framework (46). We used \u201coutgroupf3\u201d statistics to determine the amount of shared genetic drift between pairs of individuals and/or groups, as well asf4statistics for allele sharing symmetry tests (tables S5 and S6). Model-based clustering implemented in ADMIXTURE was used to investigate patterns of recent admixture, in supervised mode using European (French), East Asian (Han), Oceanian (Papuan), and Australian (WCD) individuals as putative source populations.",
            "Local ancestry deconvolution of the modern individuals was carried out using RFMix (47) and a panel of four reference populations: European (French), East Asian (Han), Oceanian (Papuan), and Australian (WCD). Before this analysis, we subsampled each reference population to the number of individuals observed in the smallest population (WCD; 12 individuals) to avoid potential bias due to unbalanced panel sizes. A \u201cmasked\u201d dataset was then obtained by restricting the analysis to SNPs for individuals who were homozygous for Australian ancestry (WCD).",
            "Haplotype sharing among modern Australians and the two highest-coverage ancient individuals (KP1 and MH8) was inferred using ChromoPainter (48). Haplotype phase was reconstructed for the full set of individuals with diploid genotypes using Shape-IT (49). We then performed chromosome painting for the two ancient individuals as recipients, using all modern Australians, as well as selected outgroups (French, Han, Papuan, and Bougainville) as potential donors. Differential sharing for the pair of ancient individuals was quantified using the symmetry statistic (50)",
            "SEs were obtained using a block jackknife across the 22 autosomes.",
            "Recovered ancient DNA sequences were authenticated using a number of methods. First, DNA damage patterns were estimated for each sample using mapDamage software (51). Samples showed a mean fragment length of 49.2 to 97.4 base pairs, with higher fragment lengths observed in the better-preserved hair samples. All samples exhibited damage patterns characteristic of ancient DNA, with elevated levels of cytosine to thymine misincorporations in the 5\u2032 end of fragments and guanine to adenine misincorporations in the 3\u2032 end (52) (table S2).",
            "Mitochondrial contamination estimates were obtained using the contDeam and Schmutzi command in the Schmutzi software package (53). The estimates obtained from contDeam are based on the assumption that only endogenous DNA has deamination patterns typical of ancient DNA and that contaminant fragments are not deaminated and will therefore only reduce overall deamination rates. The Schmutzi command iteratively refines contamination estimates and produces consensus calls (results are presented in table S2). We excluded all ancient DNA libraries that showed contamination estimates higher than 3% from further merging and analyses.",
            "It has been previously shown that deamination patterns typical of ancient DNA are rare in remains younger than 100 years in age (54), and this resulted in higher contamination estimates for the historical hair samples tested here. To verify the results obtained, we checked both the endogenous and contaminant consensus sequences generated by Schmutzi using the SAMtools tview command (35) and HaploGrep 2 (38). We showed that both endogenous and contaminant consensus sequences generated by Schmutzi carry the characteristic SNPs for the same mitochondrial haplotype.",
            "For nuclear sequences, contamination was estimated using ANGSD for all ancient males (55). All contamination estimates generated are presented in table S2.",
            "Supervised admixture of the ancient nuclear genomes was undertaken using five putative ancestry sources (fig. S9). Low levels of contamination from a European source were observed in some of the low-coverage ancient samples such as PA109, although it has been reported that using ADMIXTURE on low-coverage samples can result in statistical uncertainty associated with SNP and genotype calling, resulting in high error rates due to sampling, alignment, and sequencing errors (56). Our additional analyses using PCA confirmed that all ancient individuals cluster tightly with previously described Aboriginal Australians without recent admixture (WCD).",
            "Sex determination was carried out using the method previously described (57), comparing the morphological and archeological information provided with each set of remains. In all instances, the assigned sex was as expected, which also rules out contemporary contamination from members of the opposite sex.",

            "Ibiza was permanently settled around the 7thcentury BCE by founders arriving from west Phoenicia. The founding population grew significantly and reached its height during the 4thcentury BCE. We obtained nine complete mitochondrial genomes from skeletal remains from two Punic necropoli in Ibiza and a Bronze Age site from Formentara. We also obtained low coverage (0.47X average depth) of the genome of one individual, directly dated to 361\u2013178\u2009cal BCE, from the Cas Mol\u00ed site on Ibiza. We analysed and compared ancient DNA results with 18 new mitochondrial genomes from modern Ibizans to determine the ancestry of the founders of Ibiza. The mitochondrial results indicate a predominantly recent European maternal ancestry for the current Ibizan population while the whole genome data suggest a significant Eastern Mediterranean component. Our mitochondrial results suggest a genetic discontinuity between the early Phoenician settlers and the island\u2019s modern inhabitants. Our data, while limited, suggest that the Eastern or North African influence in the Punic population of Ibiza was primarily male dominated.",
            "The Phoenician culture was one of the most prevailing and widespread in the history of the Mediterranean basin. From its rise in the northern Levant, the Phoenicians connected east and west for over a millennium through their established trade networks across the Mediterranean, reaching beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. One of their first western outposts was the city of Gadir, modern Cadiz, on the Atlantic coast of Spain1believed to be initially settled around 1100 BCE, then became a fully-fledged Phoenician settlement by the end of the 9thcentury BCE2. Additional Phoenician settlements were established on the Balearic islands, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, and Cyprus2. These Islands form a strategic arc across the northern Mediterranean allowing for island hopping from the Levantine homeland to the Iberian Peninsula and North African coast where they established their most dominant Western Mediterranean settlement in Carthage. The early Phoenician settlements in the Western Mediterranean are generally referred to as Western Phoenicia. From the middle of the sixth century BCE onwards, with the shift in Phoenician influence from the Levant to Carthage, they are typically referred to as Punic, and from the 6thcentury BCE onward this term has become synonymous to Phoenicians outside the Levant. Our previous research has shown that the Phoenician settlers who encountered indigenous communities already living on the islands that they settled were integrated to form the new Phoenician societies3.",
            "Archaeological evidence on the largest of the Balearic Islands, Mallorca and Menorca, indicates continuous settlement since the 3rd millennium BCE. Limited evidence favours some level of continuity of prehistoric settlement in Ibiza from the end of Bronze Age until the arrival of Phoenicians in the 7thcentury BCE4. These Bronze Age settlements however, had relatively small populations compared to the larger Balearic Islands5\u20137. Ancient DNA analyses of human remains from early Ibizan sites can therefore provide evidence as to the origins of the Phoenician settlers of the island and the relationship between these early settlers and the modern population of the island. Further, when combined with other genetic data from Phoenician populations, analyses can provide key information about the process of Phoenician expansion and settlement of the Western Mediterranean.",
            "The archaeological evidence to date suggests that the Phoenicians first settled on the island of Ibiza around 654 BCE8, arriving from west Phoenicia. They initially established a small settlement at the Bay of Ibiza and a second on Sa Caleta which was later abandoned. The first settlement gave rise to the Phoenician city of Ibusim or Ebusus9. The strategic importance of Ibiza did not escape the Phoenician navigators who realized that by controlling the Bay of Ibiza they could dominate maritime movement in all the North-western Mediterranean. Phoenician presence in these prime coastal locations asserted and ensured their maritime control over the entire Mediterranean and they controlled access to the Atlantic Ocean. For several centuries, the Phoenicians dominated metal trade from the Atlantic to the Eastern Mediterranean2.",
            "The Phoenicians, and later the Punics, remained the main inhabitants of Ibiza for about seven centuries as demonstrated by the archaeological evidence from Puig des Molins, one of the largest necropoli in the Western Mediterranean, now a World Heritage site, with around 3000 tombs10,11. Burial data from this necropolis suggest three phases of the early demographic history of Ibiza11. The small founding population arrived from west Phoenicia, most probably Gadir, during the 7thcentury BCE, and they are identified by their funerary rituals, that primarily involved cremation. The second phase occurred between the 5thand 4thcenturies BCE and is indicated by a significant and rapid expansion in population size, reaching nearly 4,000 inhabitants. This growth may have been driven by a population flow from Carthage and other Punic settlements in the Mediterranean and coincides with a period of prosperity and major development of the island. The third and last phase of this early settlement period was between the 3rdand 2ndcenturies during which Ibiza witnessed a period of economic decline and the return of cremation funerary rituals. After the 2ndPunic War, Ibiza started a long process of integration in the Roman Empire, which culminated in 74 AD, when it became aLatin Municipium12. The Roman impact on the local inhabitants of Ibiza appears to have been minimal as is indicated by limited evidence of influence in the archaeological record. The Ibizan population remained somewhat isolated while under Roman political influence until the Islamic conquest of the island by Arabs and Berbers around 902 CE and they remained under Muslim rule for 333 years. Beginning around 1229 CE the Balearic Islands, including Ibiza in 1235, were impacted by immigrants from Catalonia, in mainland Spain, and the population of Ibiza slowly grew in number, but relative isolation of the autochthonous population continued and is still maintained today4,13. The extent of admixture between the indigenous Phoenician derived population of Ibiza and later occupiers has not been investigated at the genetic level, though genetic studies of the modern population of Ibiza indicate that they are distinct from the other Balearic Island and from mainland populations13\u201316. Pacelli and M\u00e1rquez-Grant17suggest that this difference may be due to the arrival of North African Punic settlers, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.",
            "Here we report ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses of archaeological remains from two Punic necropoli on Ibiza, obtained through high-throughput sequencing. We determine the maternal ancestry of the founders of Ibiza through analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of 8 archaeological samples from Ibiza. These ancient mitogenomes are compared to the first complete mitogenome data generated for 18 modern Ibizans to determine if there is genetic continuity between the original Phoenician settlers and the modern indigenous population of the island today and to elucidate the settlement history of Ibiza. The complete mitogenome from a Chalcolithic/Early Bronze-Age sample from the Island of Formentera was also obtained, providing evidence of the ancestry of the pre-Phoenician occupants of this island. Finally, we present the first genome-wide sequence data obtained from an ancient Phoenician and assess the likely ancestry of this individual from Ibiza. The accumulating aDNA evidence from Phoenicians from Ibiza, Sardinia, Tunisia and Lebanon is providing valuable information regarding the Phoenician expansion practices and the development of Phoenician communities in the Western Mediterranean.",
            "A total of 13 ancient tooth samples were obtained for aDNA analyses, from the Museu Arqueologic d\u2019Elvissa i Formentera, in Ibiza, Spain: eleven samples from the urban Puig des Molins Necropolis, in the town of Eivissa11,18,19; one sample from the Cas Mol\u00ed site, in Sant Antoni de Portmany20, also from the island of Ibiza; and one sample from the megalithic chamber tomb from the site of Ca na Costa, on Formentera21. The archaeological context for these samples is provided in the Supplemental Data1. We were able to obtain data to reconstruct complete or near complete mitogenomes from nine of these samples and 0.47X average depth of coverage of the whole genome of the Cas Mol\u00ed sample (MS10614).",
            "A total of 18 modern DNA samples, obtained from volunteers from Ibiza, initially sampled by researchers from the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (IBE), Barcelona, as part of a study on Y chromosomes and surnames, were sent to the University of Otago for full mitogenome sequencing. Individuals were only included in the sampling if all four grandparents were born on Ibiza and carried Ibizan surnames.",
            "All ancient DNA processing was conducted in a dedicated aDNA facility at the University of Otago. DNA was extracted from archaeological teeth using standard protocols22. Double stranded Illumina libraries were constructed with dual barcodes for the ancient samples as described previously23, and the mitochondrial DNA was captured using hybridization with modern human mitochondrial bait, generated in our lab24.",
            "Modern DNA samples were sent by CSIC-UPF to the University of Otago where they were processed in a separate lab from the aDNA facility, and mitogenomes were amplified, prepared and sequenced as described previously23.",
            "All ancient sequences obtained were assessed for potential contamination and DNA damage patterns. Deamination and fragment lengths were all as expected for ancient samples (Supplementary Data2). Consensus sequences were created (including indels) and deposited in GenBank. Sequences were assigned to haplogroups using Haplogrep25with Phylotree build 1726. All aDNA reads generated have been submitted to the NCBI sequence read archive identified by lab sample number. All mtDNA haplogroup determinations for samples processed in this study and associated archaeological site names, dates, GenBank accession numbers, coverage and contamination estimates are shown in Table1. Additional sample information is provided in Supplementary Table1. All ancient samples processed showed minimal estimates of contamination except for sample MS10589, from Formentara, which returned an estimate of 14%. We therefore filtered the data to only include damaged reads which resulted in reduced coverage but the same haplogroup call, so we included this pre-Phoenician sample in our analyses.",

            "One ancient sample (MS10614) was selected for shotgun sequencing, based on the high genome coverage observed in the mitochondrial sequencing of this sample. Adequate preservation was confirmed with an estimated 9% endogenous DNA content. The sex of this sample was determined based on computing the number of alignments to the Y Chromosome (nY) as a fraction of the total alignments to both sex chromosomes (nX\u2009+\u2009nY)27. The ratio of Y:X\u2009+\u2009Y coverage was 0.0042 (SE 0.0001, 95% CI 0.0041\u20130.0044) and thus the individual was determined to be female, which is inconsistent with the sex determination based on skeletal characteristics. After mapping the shotgun reads to the UCSC reference genome hg19, the resulting bam file was aligned with the Human Origins SNP dataset to call a pseudo-haploid genotype28. This genotype was merged with previously published ancient29,30and modern SNP data sets31\u201333, resulting in a total of 119,316 SNPs used in subsequent analyses (See Supplementary Table2).",
            "A subsample of the tooth from which the DNA was extracted was sent to Beta Analytic Inc. (Miami) for AMS dating. It returned a conventional radiocarbon age of 2190 \u00b1 30, which provided a calibrated date range of 361\u2013178\u2009cal BC (2310\u20132127\u2009cal BP), at 95.4% probability.

To provide more context within the European cluster we first added to our initial PCA analyses data from modern Iberians33(IBS) and Levantine populations from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel32. The Ibizan sample plotted within the Levantine cluster, outside of the modern Iberians (Supplemental Fig.4b). When considering more fine-grained analysis including only the Levantine and Iberian modern data with MS10614, the Ibizan positioned between the Iberian and Levantine samples, with more affinity to the Levantine populations (Fig.6a). We conducted a further test, adding North African populations48to the analyses (Fig.6b) and see that MS10614 is situated more closely to the Levantine and Iberian samples and not the North Africans. Finally, since modern populations are likely to have changed significantly in the 2000\u2009+\u2009years since the Phoenician expansion, we undertook similar analyses to assess the relationship between MS10614 and other ancient populations (Fig.6c).

            "Most Phoenician trading ports were initially founded in locations where there was already an established indigenous community, resulting in integration of locals into the growing Phoenician settlement. The settlement history of Ibiza offers a valuable opportunity to investigate the genetic makeup of a Phoenician population where there was a relatively very small indigenous population at the time of Phoenician arrival. Being a likely secondary Phoenician settlement from the city of Gadir, the early population of Ibiza also potentially provides information about Phoenician settlements on the Iberian mainland. The data presented here adds to our previous research investigating admixture in Phoenician settlements across the Western Mediterranean3,23. It also helps dissect and possibly identify the origins of the various populations that ultimately contributed to the genetic makeup of the modern Ibizans.",
            "Our analyses of the mitogenomes of the ancient samples from Ibiza indicate a predominantly European maternal ancestry for the population (Fig.1). Haplogroups H1 and H3, which either emerged from the Franco-Iberian refugia of the LGM50,51, or arrived with early Neolithic expansions, account for 50% of the Ibizan ancient samples (see Table1). Szecseny-Nagyet al.38also found similarly high rates of haplogroup H in their analyses of the Hyper-Variable Region (HVR) of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Iberian samples. Investigating coding region SNPs, they showed that among haplogroup H, 65% belonged to hg H1 and 14% to hg H3. Particularly high frequencies of H1 and H3 are also seen in ancient and modern Sardinians3,34. The majority of the remaining haplogroups present in the Phoenician population of Ibiza, U4a, U5b, and T2b have all been identified in Mesolithic or Neolithic populations in Western Europe including Iberia38,52,53. Haplogroup U5b3 frequencies, though generally low across Europe, are the highest today in Sardinia and Spanish Andalusia54and are thus also consistent with an Iberian origin or possible contacts with Phoenician Sardinia. Haplogroup J1c is thought to have an eastern Mediterranean origin and has been identified in several Neolithic samples in Eastern Europe and in a Chalcolithic sample (2880\u20132630 BCE) from the El Mirador Cave site, Atapuerca, Spain55. Haplogroup J1c has not been found previously in any ancient samples in the Levant and appears to have been distributed across Europe with the Neolithic expansion, suggesting that it may have been picked up in Northern Anatolia30. Olivieriet al.34found a J1c3 haplotype in one of their ancient samples from Sardinia (MA74), dated to 6190\u20136000 calBP and thus its presence in our Puig des Molins samples is not unexpected, as this lineage was clearly present in the Western Mediterranean region at the time that Ibiza was settled. The primary Phoenician settlers of Ibiza are likely to have be males who sailed from Gadir and the presence of these haplogroups provides additional support to our previous work suggesting that local female integration was a hallmark of Phoenician settlement history across the Mediterranean basin3.",
            "Our previous analyses of Phoenician mtDNA from Monte Sirai, Sardinia, another Western Mediterranean Phoenician and Punic settlement, indicated significant integration of indigenous women among the predominantly male Phoenician settlers3. We suggest a similar pattern is indicated for the Phoenician settlement of Ibiza. When we investigated the relationships of mitogenomes of Phoenician populations from Lebanon, Sardinia and Ibiza (Fig.5) we found that there was no particular affinity amongst Phoenician populations (circles) when compared to pre-Phoenician or modern populations from those locations. This may indicate that local female integration was indeed a common strategy of Phoenician settlements. We expect that the integration of indigenous women from south central coastal Iberia into the Phoenician settlement of Gadir must have also occurred and that the ancient mitochondrial lineages observed Ibiza were brought along from Gadir or, alternatively, from some other Phoenician settlement in the Central or Western Mediterranean. Analyses of ancient Phoenician samples from Gadir and complete mitogenomic sequencing of ancient samples from across the Iberian Peninsula are needed to fully test this explanation. Analyses of HVR sequences from Neolithic and Early Bronze Age samples from the Iberian peninsula38and modern southern Iberian populations56indicate that there may be differences between the southwest and southeast Iberian populations, and it may be possible to locate particular regions of the Iberian coast from which these mtDNA lineages originated.",
            "There was a sizable increase in the number of the Punic burials at Puig des Molins during the 5thand 4thcenturies BCE, indicating a surge in the population size of Ibiza10. This increase is largely attributed by historians to the movement of people from other prospering Phoenician/Punic settlements in nearby Sardinia and Carthage10. Despite anthropological evidence supporting the presence of North and sub-Saharan African ancestry in Punic individuals from the Island of Ibiza57, mitochondrial lineages exclusively associated with North Africa or the Near East were not observed in our ancient Ibizan samples, although several of these lineages were previously identified in Phoenician samples from Sardinia, i.e. haplogroup N1b1a53. Our results cannot, however, rule out the arrival of admixed individuals with European maternal ancestry from Phoenician sites in Sardinia, North Africa or the Iberian mainland. In fact, we previously identified a likely Iberian mtDNA haplotype, U5b2c1, in a young Carthaginian23, suggesting the presence of an admixed population there by late 6thcentury BCE. We also note that haplogroups H1 and H3, while European in origin, are also found at high frequency in North African populations, particularly H1, which is today found at levels of 40\u201345% in northwest Africa56,58. Haplogroup H1bc was identified in a Bronze Age sample from Sidon29and H1 is present in modern Lebanese3. It is therefore possible, that these H lineages could have been brought to Ibiza, with Phoenicians from either the Levantine homeland or North Africa. It is a more parsimonious suggestion, however, that their presence in Ibiza is due to a more direct European and probably and Iberian source, particularly given the lack of any mitogenomes of clear North African or Near Eastern origin identified in the ancient Ibizan population sampled thus far. The morphological characteristics indicating African ancestry in crania from Punic contexts in Ibiza identified by M\u00e1rquez-Grant57could be consistent with our aDNA results if the African admixture in Ibiza was male dominated. Alternatively, aDNA analyses of additional Phoenician samples from Ibiza may indeed find non-European mtDNA lineages, but to date, we have only observed what appears to be a typical European, and primarily Western European signature.",
            "Unfortunately, to really dissect population mtDNA histories generally, and those of southwest Europe or any region with high rates of haplogroup H in particular, complete mitogenome sequencing is necessary. Despite the large sample sizes for studies of HVR sequences for the Iberian Peninsula38,59, there are few complete ancient mitogenome sequences publicly available particularly beyond the Basque region. As Hernandezet al.56point out, secure assignment to haplogroup H is not possible based on control region sequencing alone, as it requires identification of T7028C. Further sub-typing of haplogroup H also requires the identification of key coding region SNPs (for example, G3010A for H1, T6776C for H3).",
            "In addition to the ancient Ibiza samples, we sequenced a complete mitogenome of a Late Chalcolithic/Early-Bronze Age sample (MS10589) from the Ca na Costa site on the island of Formentera which was determined to belong to the K1a1b haplogroup. Mathiesonet al.55identified K1a1b1 in a Middle Neolithic Iberian sample (Mina3) with an archaeological context dated to 3900\u20133600 BCE. In their analyses of mtDNA hypervariable region sequences obtained from ancient samples from Neolithic and Iron-Age necropoli from Mallorca and Menorca, Sim\u00f3net al.39found that 4.34% belonged to Haplogroup K, with the highest frequency (10%) in the oldest (Neolithic) necropolis, Cova des Pas, on Minorca. Our K1a1b result may indicate that the initial settlement of Formentera, prior to the arrival of the Phoenicians, also likely came from the mainland or via Mallorca, an observation presented by Bellard4. Olivieriet al.34found K1a and K1b1b1 in pre-Phoenician Sardinians, but we have yet to find haplogroup K in any of our Phoenician samples.",
            "Ibiza has had a complex history of resettlement periods since the time of the Phoenicians. In addition to a Phoenician founding population, modern Ibizans would have had potential genetic influences from later Punic settlements, like Carthage and our ancient DNA data are consistent with this scenario. Historic records would suggest that the Ibizan genetic signature was also likely influenced by the arrival of Arab and Berber populations during the first millennium CE and finally, from 1200 CE, it was said to be overwhelmed by mainland colonists. This might explain the discontinuity between the ancient and modern DNA results we observed, shown in Fig.3and is consistent with the results of Ramon and colleagues13, based on HLA markers and blood groups in Ibizans, and earlier mtDNA14and Y-chromosome15studies which show affinities to North African and Near Eastern populations.",
            "Our TempNet results showed little continuity between the Phoenician inhabitants of the island and the modern Ibizan population. No shared haplotypes were found and only one haplogroup, T2b, was found in both groups. Perhaps most surprising was that neither haplogroups H1 or H3 were found in the modern Ibizans. These two haplogroups were not only the most common in our ancient population but are found at high frequencies in both modern North African and Western European populations generally56. The modern Ibizan population is singularly unusual in the entire Western Mediterranean region for their apparent lack of these two common haplogroups. It is possible that the mtDNA frequencies are so different from the ancient samples due to random genetic drift, which is common in small island populations. The small sample size (n\u2009=\u200918) could also be a factor, though our result indicating that the modern Ibizans are genetically quite different to mainland populations is consistent with previous studies13,14,16,39.",
            "Haplogroups T1 and V, found in the modern Ibizans, are lineages found at reasonably high frequencies in the Near East. Haplogroup V is also found in\u00a0both ancient and modern populations from the Iberian Peninsula and in ancient samples from Mallorca and Minorca, and T1 is also found at low frequency in mainland Spain today14,32,55. These lineages are also found in Berbers which could explain their presence in the modern Ibizans. Haplogroup L2c however, which was identified in two unrelated, modern Ibizans, has not been found in Berbers60. It is typically a West African, sub-Saharan lineage and it may have been introduced during the Islamic expansion which had significant exchange with the entire African continent. Alternatively, it could have been a more recent arrival, perhaps the result of the transatlantic slave trade59. Botigu\u00e9et al.61, showed in their whole genome analyses that sub-Saharan ancestry was less than 1% in Europe, except for the Canary Islands, where Maca-Meyeret al.62found L2c in both 17thand 18thcentury historic and modern individuals. Another sub-Saharan lineage, L1b has also been identified in a Late Chalcolithic population in central Iberia38and in one 7thcentury CE sample from Mallorca39.",
            "The remaining lineages identified in modern Ibizans are all either exclusively European markers (e.g. J2b1a63) or are widely distributed across Europe and the Near East and identifying the specific origin of the population influx that causes the discontinuity between ancient and modern Ibizans is difficult. The FSTresults for the complete mitogenomes shown in Fig.4do not indicate a single likely source, though the closest population to modern Ibizans appears to be France. France may be acting as a proxy for a more likely source of settlers to Ibiza, namely Catalonia, since it has been shown to be genetically closely related64. Further whole genome analyses of the modern indigenous Ibizans would provide the necessary data to fully assess the origins of this population, but from a mitochondrial perspective, it appears that they are not directly related to the Phoenician and Punic founding populations and thus this is not the explanation for the unusual genetic signature.",
            "While the mitochondrial evidence suggests that the founding female population of Ibiza was primarily derived from a mainland Iberian source, the results of the whole genome analyses of sample MS10614 indicate a significant Eastern Mediterranean/Levantine component. Sample MS10614 comes from an individual that was part of a collective burial inside a Punic hypogeum at Can Portes des Jurat, Cas Mol\u00ed20. The sample was directly radiocarbon dated to 361\u2013178\u2009cal BCE. The archaeological context of the burial also suggests a 3rdcentury BCE date and thus this individual lived during the period of greater Punic influence of Ibiza or just after this period of population growth.",
            "As can be seen in Fig.6a,b, the Ibizan Phoenician sample, MS10614, plots in between modern Levantine and Iberian populations but closer to both of these than to modern North African populations. In Fig.6c, it is positioned most closely to a Levantine Neolithic sample, but in between a Sidon Bronze Age and European/Iberian Bronze Age samples. The ADMIXTURE result (k\u2009=\u20092) in Fig.7also indicates that the genetic ancestry of this individual was intermediate between an Iberian Bronze Age and Levantine Bronze Age individuals. The result of k\u2009=\u20093, however, shows a third component (dark blue) found in Anatolian and Levantine Neolithic and Bronze Age individuals. This component is present in the ancient Ibizan and also present in modern Spanish. We suggest that this third component represents the Western Iranian Neolithic farmers that had admixed with the Levantine and Anatolian Neolithic populations30. Levantine Bronze Age populations were further admixed with this component from both Anatolian Chalcolithic and Levantine Neolithic ancestry. This component is not present in ancient Iberians, supporting the notion that the main ancestral population of early European farmers were the Neolithic North-Western Anatolians before they were admixed with the Iranians30. The presence of this component in modern Iberians is likely the result of historic influences.",
            "The mtDNA haplogroup of this individual, T2b, indicates that the direct maternal ancestry is likely local and the Levantine contribution may therefore represent paternal ancestry. This finding is in line with previous work by our group using Y-chromosome data showing East Mediterranean Y signatures across the Phoenician settlements in the West, including Ibiza. These signatures, attributed to the Phoenicians, were found to be present at the frequency of 6% among the modern male populations studied, indicating a substantial Phoenician male presence in settlements across the Western Mediterranean65. The Near Eastern component to the genome of this individual may represent that of the founding Phoenician population, though the possibility that this individual or a recent ancestor may have arrived directly from the Levantine homeland or from Punic settlements in North Africa or elsewhere in the Phoenician interaction network cannot be ruled out, though the sample does not appear to be closely related to modern North African populations as shown in Fig.6b.",
            "In conclusion, our results show a complex pattern of settlement of the island of Ibiza. We demonstrate a clear genetic discontinuity between the early Phoenician settlers and the modern inhabitants of the island based on the mtDNA results. Thus, the unusual genetic signature of modern Ibizans is not likely to be the result of their Phoenician ancestry, at least from a mitochondrial perspective. It appears that multiple population arrivals through invasions or other movements combined with periods of population instability since the early Phoenician settlement may have led to a total reshuffling of the genetic makeup of this island. Over the last several centuries Ibiza witnessed population growth supported by the arrival of mainland populations to the island, followed by significant population reduction resulting from the bubonic plague and malaria13. These events, combined with a founder effect, and inbreeding common in islands with a relatively small population such as Ibiza, could have resulted in the loss of the indigenous mtDNA signatures observed in the ancient samples we analysed. It appears that the lineages present in the Phoenicians of Ibiza were replaced by different European mtDNA haplogroups (which appear to be most closely related to those of modern French but likely also similar to Catalonians). Despite this lack of continuity observed in the mitochondrial genomes, previous Y chromosome analyses suggest that there is still some Phoenician signature in the modern Ibizan population. This is consistent with historical evidence suggesting that Phoenician influence in the West was male dominated and indicates that there was not a total replacement of the Ibizan founding population. Comparisons of the ancient Phoenician whole genome data with whole genome data from modern Ibizans will help clarify this point further. Finally, the whole genome data obtained from the ancient Ibizan sample belonged to an individual with a significant Eastern Mediterranean component, suggesting an admixed Phoenician community in Ibiza during the 3rd century BCE. While this result is consistent with the archaeological evidence and further indicates that diversity was a hallmark of Phoenician societies, it also highlights the complexity of island population settlements and underscores the importance of the inclusion of ancient DNA analysis in population genetics.",

            "In all the considered scenarios involving modern populations and MS10614, the Principal Component Analyses were produced calculating the eigenvectors with smartpca; the ancient sample was projected setting the lsqproject parameter to yes in the smartpca parameter file. In every case we only took into account those SNPs that were common to the merged datasets and the ancient sample. No minor allele frequency filter, or LD pruning were performed. In modern samples, only variants and samples with many missing calls were filtered out (>5% and >10%, respectively). Also, variants failing a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium exact test were discarded (p\u2009<\u200910\u22125).",
            "For the ancient samples, PCA was performed using the merged dataset containing the Phoenician Ibizan (MS10614), ancient individuals from Lazaridiset al.30, and Bronze Age samples from Sidon29, using the \u2018smartpca\u2019 software from the Eigensoft package78.",
            "Admixture: The ADMIXTURE v 1.3 software49was used on a subset of the above merged dataset, comprised of the Phoenician Ibizan, Neolithic Anatolians, Late Neolithic-Bronze Age Europeans, Bronze Age Iberians, Bronze Age Levantines, Neolithic Levantines, modern Lebanese, modern Spanish, Bronze Age Sidon samples, and modern Tunisian populations. The ancestry proportions of these populations were assessed by testing clusters ofK=\u20091\u201310 (shown in Supplemental Data5).",
            "F3and D statistics: Outgroup f3statistics were computed using the \u2018qp3pop\u2019 tool from the Admixtools package79in the form of f3(Mbuti; X; MS10614) where \u2018X\u2019 tests all populations in the merged dataset. Based on the results of the outgroup f3statistics, the \u2018qpDstat\u2019 tool from the Admixtools package50in the form ofD(MS10614; X; Y; Mbuti), where \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 tests populations identified as being ancestral to MS10614 in the f3and PCA analyses (Supplemental Data6and Table5).",
