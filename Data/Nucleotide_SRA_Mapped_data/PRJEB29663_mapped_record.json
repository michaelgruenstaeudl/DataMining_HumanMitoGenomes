These analyses revealed substantial genetic structure between individuals from different geographic regions, with three distinct clades observed (Fig. 4, A and B). To further characterize their relationships, we fitted the highest-coverage ancient individual from each region onto an admixture graph using qpGraph (Fig. 5). We found that the deepest divergence separated the ancient individual from Kalgoorlie/Golden Ridge (ANC) from all remaining individuals. Within the eastern clade, we identified a trifurcation among the three major geographic regions (Fig. 5) without any apparent closer relationship between the groups from north-western (MH8 and WPAH4) and north-eastern Queensland (PA86) with respect to the individuals from New South Wales (WLH4 and KP1) (Fig. 5). Notably, we detected ~13% Papuan-related ancestry in the individual from Cairns (PA86). This was also observed for contemporary individuals from the same region (20)."

Our additional analyses using PCA confirmed that all ancient individuals cluster tightly with previously described Aboriginal Australians without recent admixture (WCD)."
