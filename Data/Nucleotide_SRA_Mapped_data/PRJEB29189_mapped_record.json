We found one sample from Andalusia (southern Spain) to carry the sub-Saharan mitochondrial haplogroup L2a1, to our knowledge never observed before in ancient human remains outside Africa. In addition, the analyses of the ancient nuclear genomes revealed an increased similarity between Middle Neolithic/Chalcolithic (MN/ChL) samples from Spain and ancient sub-Saharan remains. To our knowledge, this study reports for the first time, both at nuclear and mitochondrial level, direct evidence of prehistoric northbound gene flow from Africa into Europe, probably following a trans-Mediterranean western route."
